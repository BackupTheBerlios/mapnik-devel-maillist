<PRE>Hi Artem,
Hi list,

</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good to me! I like the idea of  keeping both ptree and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, I haven't done any benchmarking yet. I just got it working  
yesterday night :-) . My current implementation loads the XML file  
into a DOM and then populates a boost ptree with the result. The  
ptree is then processed by the existing load_map(). This keeps the  
whole parsing logic in one place, but costs a bit performance because  
the DOM is copied to a ptree. BTW, I think the tinyxml parser does  
something similar. So this should not be worse. I'd also guess that  
libxml2 is a bit slower than tinyxml (more overhead). But I think it  
will be difficult to measure any difference because lots of other  
stuff happens during load_map(), like loading icon files from disk,  
establish DB connections, &amp;c.
But if you insist I'll try to do some benchmarks ...


&gt;<i> There is a flag XMLPARSER={spirit,tinyxml} to build ptree with  
</I>&gt;<i> different impl. We can add libxml to the list?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The current behaviour is as follows: If the (new) XML2_CONFIG build  
option is set to the xml2-config executable libxml2 is used and  
HAVE_LIBXML2 is defined. Otherwise it uses the flags currently  
specified in the toplevel SConstruct script (- 
DBOOST_PROPERTY_TREE_XML_PARSER_TINYXML that is). I don't want to  
make changes to the boost code. Future releases of boost will contain  
the property_tree lib and we might want to drop the local copy.


&gt;<i> Also,  how difficult to build libxml on win32?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good point! I haven't checked that yet, but a quick glance at the  
google results indicates that it is possible to build it using MSVC.  
This page has the &quot;official&quot; win32 binaries:

Although this guy seems to use a different (MS) compiler. See 'Notes'  
on his website...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ugly conflicts. ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a small possibility I might have to tweak load_map a  
</I>&gt;<i> little bit (add new entities)  , but we can merge changes back ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok, if you have to tweak it just go ahead. Surely it can be merged  
later. It just ain't fun. I think the only lines that I haven't  
touched are the include guards ;-)


&gt;<i> Another  option would be to create a branch for libxml stuff and  
</I>&gt;<i> merge it into the main trunk when it's ready ? I can give you svn  
</I>&gt;<i> write access just let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That would be great! Thanks a lot.

One more question:
Currently mapnik ignores unknown elements/attributes in the XML file.  
This is very XMLish but as a consequence typos are not detected.  
Other things, like parse errors in filter expressions only print an
obscure warning. This is fine for the developers, but it's a little  
bit frustrating for API users that are not familiar with the sources  
and/or the syntax (like me :-) ).

I personally would prefer a very strict API behaviour:
Throw exceptions on severe errors like:
	- XML is not well formed (of course)
	- unknown elements/attributes in the XML file
	- syntax errors in filter expressions, colors, &amp;c
	- failed DB connections

GUI applications could bring up dialogs containing the error  
description. python scripts could terminate with non zero exit codes  
instead of writing an empty png.
For other configuration errors, like missing icons, a warning should  
suffice. Although GUI applications might want to redirect these  
warnings to some form of message sink. But this can wait ...

If you agree I'd be happy to help to get at least some of this stuff  
done.

Another one:
I noticed that all your files use the following include order:
#include &lt;std_headers&gt;
#include &lt;3rd_party.h&gt;
#include &lt;local_header.hpp&gt;

I'm used to include local headers first. Why do you include them  
last? Just curious ...

cheers,
	david
