Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Worst time taken by Mapnik while rendering map...
	Please help me!!!
Message-ID: <fb300571.1ca463e.22342a.4e89@decos.in>

Hi friends, 

Hope you find this mail in good health. 

I have created a map rendering application using Mapnik & Python. I have implemented basic operation on map rendering too. 

The major problem is large time taken by Mapnik to render a map. 

I am rendering a map by firing queries on postgreSql database & assigning this data to various layers of map & finally rendering map by calling function render_to_file(). 
I have defined various styles & rules function similar to osm.xml style sheet with filter, maxscale & minscale parameters to filter our data at various zoom level. 

When I am rendering map using Europe data & it is taking  time about 5 to 6 minutes for rendering map image. 
Again whenever I perform some operation like zoom in, zoom out, pan etc ; it takes same amount of time. 

Most people recommended tile server as solution to this problem but  I can?t use tile server. 
Because I have to provide ?route planning & management? as one of the feature of my project, and I guess this will not be possible using tile server. 

I guessed using ?estimate_extent & extent? parameter in PostGIS function could help me out of this. 
But when I tried it skipped most of the data from query result and rendered map with very low details. 

Could you please help me out of this problem? 
Please do provide me some concrete solution for this issue. 

Expecting your helping hands toward me. 

Thanks in Advance 

Balram

Mapnik-dev,

While this list is fairly quiet, we have quite a bit of development  
activity and discussion on the Trac site via tickets. In many ways I  
think this is ideal as discussions are logged nicely against issues  
and not all people subscribe to the mapnik-devel list.

But, it raises the question: Should we cc ticket activity to mapnik- 
devel so that people subscribed can also follow ticket activity?

Post your vote, + or -.

Thanks,

Dane

Sounds good to me.

So long as they are tagged so we can differentiate mailing list messages 
vs Trac messages.
Either that or another mailing list, mapnik-trac ?

Cheers,
Dave.

+1
I'd rather see a separate list for that, but I like the general idea.
On a completely unrelated note I would love to see mapnik-checkins
list where all the trunk activity would be logged, as it's easier for
someone like me to follow development of mapnik just by reading diffs.

That sounds good. How about we revive 'mapnik-svn' (maybe rename to  
'mapnik-code' or something) and send both commits and ticket comments  
to it?

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Contributing to Postgres/PostGIS testing framework
Message-ID: <98E176F7-BC5A-4003-B1B0-92FCADE35ED9@hailmail.net>

So, we've got this great testing framework in trunk now (thanks Beau).

To use it just do:

$ sudo easy_install nose # uses [1]
$ svn co http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk mapnik
$ cd mapnik
$ python tests/run_tests.py # requires you have mapnik installed

... but we've not covering PostGIS yet.

As a GeoDjango user I'm spoiled by this nice PostGIS testing framework  
[2].

Anyone have experience, time, or interest in writing Mapnik tests  
against PostGIS?

This would be an excellent thing to have going for the next release.

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Some patches for Shield and Text Symbolizers
Message-ID: <4ADB11FE.5090505@shaw.ca>

I have attached some changes that I thought would enhance mapnik.  I've 
generated the diff set against trunk version 1331 and are attached.  I 
did not attempt to modify the other interface or subsystems (python or 
cario) to support the new/changed parameters.  If you have any 
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
Dave

Change log:

1.  Modified Text Symbolizer

    a) corrected line fragment centering (for 2nd and subsequent lines, 
when line breaks occur).

    b) adjusted vertical alignment calculation so that:
        i)      middle -> has the center of the text line(s) at the 
point origin
        ii)     bottom -> has the text line(s) below the point origin
        iii)    top -> has the text line(s) above the point origin

    c) added new text_symbolizer attribute: 'wrap_before', value range: 
true/false, default == false

       allows line breaks at first wrap_char before wrap_width as an 
alternative to the original
       which was to create the line break at the first wrap_char after 
wrap_width

    d) added new text_symbolizer attribute: 'horizontal_alignment', 
value range: left/middle/right, default == middle
        i)      left -> has all text line(s) to left of the point origin
        ii)     middle -> has all text line(s) centered on the the point 
origin
        iii)    right -> has all text line(s) to the right of the point 
origin

        NOTE:   dx, dy position adjustments are applied after alignments 
and before Justify.

    e) added new text_symbolizer attribute: 'justify_alignment', value 
range: left/middle/right, default == middle
        i)      left -> after alignments, has all text line(s) are left 
justified (left to right reading)
        ii)     middle -> after alignments, has all text line(s) center 
justified
        iii)    right -> after alignments, has all text line(s) right 
justified (right to left reading)

    f) added new text_symbolizer attribute:  'opacity', value range: 0.0 
thru 1.0; 1.0 == fully opaque

    g) modified positioning to compensate for both line_spacing and 
character_spacing, to ensure proper
       centering of the text envelope.  Also ensure that centering 
occurs correctly even if no wrapping
       occurs.  Line spacing is uniform and consistent and compensates 
for errors between text_size and
       the actual size (ci.height is inconsistent, depending on case and 
character); fixes issue with
       multi-line text where some lines have a slight gap and others are 
compressed together.


2.  Modified shield_symbolizer

    a) added the attributes:
        i)      allow_overlap
        ii)     vertical_alignment
        iii)    horizontal_alignment
        iv)     justify_alignment
        v)      wrap_width
        vi)     wrap_character
        vii)    wrap_before
        viii)   text_convert
        ix)     line_spacing
        x)      character_spacing
        xi)     opacity

    b)  added new shield_symbolizer attribute: 'unlock_image', value 
range: true/false, default == false
        i)  false == image and text placement behaviour same as before
        ii) true == image placement independant of text, image is always 
centered at geometry point, text placed per attributes,
                    dx/dy only affect text.

        Allows user to create point markers with text, but both the text 
and image rendering collision detection are done
        as a pair (they come and go together - solves problem if using 
point_symbolizer and text_symbolizers where one or the
        other are omitted due to overlaps, but not both)

    c)  extended choices for the attribute 'placement' to include 
vertex; effect is limited to the shield_symbolizer

        Allows an attempted placement at every vertex available, gives 
additional shield placement volume when using line geometry

    d)  ensured that the text placement was not updating the detector 
unless a shield image was actually placed.

    e)  added new shield_symbolizer attribute: 'no_text', value range: 
true/false, default = false

        When set true, the text for the feature is ignored ('space' 
subsituted) so that pure graphic symbols can be used
        and no text is rendered over top of them.

Hi David,

Great, thanks very much for contributing to Mapnik! I applied your
patch against latest trunk ( r1340 ) and everything builds/runs fine.
I'm yet to try new parameters, though. I might apply your changes to
the trunk so we can have a play.

Regards,
Artem

Hi 

Here is the paths.py file

mapniklibpath="c:\mapnik_0_6_1\lib\mapnik"
inputpluginspath=mapniklibpath + "c:\mapnik_0_6_1\plugins\input"
fontscollectionpath = mapniklibpath + "\fonts"


Another issue is that I don't think the mapnik_0_6_1 folder contains all the required sub-folders. I had to take the demo and plugins folders from the stable repository. I edited the path.py file so that the paths to lib\mapnik and plugins are correct but the error is still produced.

I think inputpluginspath should be :

inputpluginspath=mapniklibpath + "\input" !!!

I have started the installation process again following the instructions at http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/WindowsInstallation

When I get to step 6, there is no c:\mapnik_0_6_1\demo\python folder so I can't run rundemo.py

Please advise.

Yes, 'mapnik_0_6_1' win32 binaries were released without demo
directory - this is a known issue (bug). I should get around
correcting this, but meanwhile you can just copy demo directory from
0_6_0 release.

Best,
Artem

Yes, 'mapnik_0_6_1' win32 binaries were released without demo
directory - this is a known issue (bug). I should get around
correcting this, but meanwhile you can just copy demo directory from
0_6_0 release.

Best,
Artem

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] mapnik maintainership in Debian
Message-ID: <20091025160511.GZ4383@urchin.earth.li>

I've been maintaining Debian packages of mapnik for a while, but I've
never been a serious user and I think it's probably time to hand this
off to someone else.

It probably makes sense for this package to be maintained by the Debian
GIS team aka pkg-grass-devel (AIUI). Do people agree?

I have a private subversion repository used for maintaining the package
so far which I'm happy to extract the history from, if someone can tell
me the best place to put this.

Christophe Sauthier (CC'd) has been looking after this package in
Ubuntu, and has offered to help, but I believe he would need his
uploads to be sponsored for Debian.

Cheers,
Dominic.

Dear Dominic, all,

Indeed I have been looking at the package in Ubuntu for a while and
I'd like to help more by helping on the Debian one too...
Even if indeed my uploads needs to be sponsored in debian.

So I'd be more than happy to help you and the GIS team on that task.

All the best,

      Christophe

Thanks,

Please see also the wnpp bug I filed about this, 

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=551281

(I should have included this in my original CC to connect the two
threads; apologies).

This is not a problem and I also think other people who are
interested in OSM related programs can help. Please use
a common svn or git repository, as available in pkg-grass 
group.

I'm more than willing to maintain it under the pkg-grass umbrella.

Dominic, if you could publish your SVN repository somewhere, I'll convert it
to a git repository (if Christophe is ok with that), and push it on
git.debian.org.

Christophe: I'm a DM, so only the first upload needs a sponsor DD. Afterwards
I can upload the package directly. I have no problems with Python, but might
need some help with the C++ part of the package.

Kindly,
David

Thanks to help from the Debian GIS team I have migrated my private
subversion repository to git, for team maintainership.

It's available at

http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-grass/mapnik.git

With that off my hands, I plan to take a back seat in mapnik and I'll
be unsubscribing from -devel after posting this.

Best wishes,
Dominic.
