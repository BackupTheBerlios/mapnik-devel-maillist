&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the first week of GSoC already over, here's my first status
</I>&gt;<i> report. I'm planning to do one each Sunday evening, I'm curious myself
</I>&gt;<i> though how punctual I'm going to be on that point ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The past week (well the past 4 or 5 weeks actually) I've spend on
</I>&gt;<i> the VS project file generator. It's shaping up now - I've started over
</I>&gt;<i> a couple of times and finally settled on the most simple design, the
</I>&gt;<i> one that I started out with the first time. Specs of project- and
</I>&gt;<i> solution files are done in simple yaml files, processed by the 'vs4os'
</I>&gt;<i> Python program and using the Jinja2 template library rendered into
</I>&gt;<i> their output formats.
</I>
Is vs2os something you have written? How well does it look like it can be integrated into SCons?

How does it compare to existing VS support in SCons?

&gt;<i> For now I focus on VS9, other versions could be
</I>&gt;<i> added at some point. The most basic functionality works and I can
</I>&gt;<i> build a couple of the simpler mapnik dependencies (zlib, jpeg,
</I>&gt;<i> libtiff).
</I>
Nice.

&gt;<i> Although I still think that choosing Python is the right
</I>&gt;<i> choice in the given context, my relative lack of experience with it is
</I>&gt;<i> proving a rather painful stumbling block; for example, I spend the
</I>&gt;<i> whole day today on figuring out how unicode support works in Python in
</I>&gt;<i> general, in Visual Studio and in the template library I use; and how
</I>&gt;<i> to make them work together. Not fun but at least it works now :)
</I>
Jump on IRC and ask questions! Also of course unicode is a narly thing in python, hence python 3k.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the coming week I have planned:
</I>&gt;<i> - Clean my source tree / directory layout up and check everything into
</I>&gt;<i> a branch in svn. I haven't made one yet because I need to get my ssh
</I>&gt;<i> key to work and that's a royal pain with putty etc so I've been
</I>&gt;<i> putting it off;
</I>
I've heard this is totally doable with putty, hrm...

When you get it working, please document on the wiki.

&gt;<i> I'm also working in an old checkout of the 0.7 branch
</I>&gt;<i> I had laying around so I'm going to need to decide first how that
</I>&gt;<i> should work.
</I>
Let me know how we can help.

&gt;<i> - Do some communications things: blog post (Dane, how do I log on to
</I>&gt;<i> the Mapnik 'news' section?
</I>&gt;<i> Can I post to the blog myself somehow?),
</I>
Yes, I created a login for you. Get in touch by private email with questions.

&gt;<i> finally upload the minutes from the Skype meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> - Get the other dependencies working - Cairo, and maybe if I'm feeling
</I>&gt;<i> masochistic ICU.
</I>
ICU should come first since it is not optional to Mapnik.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some other things:
</I>&gt;<i> - About the buildbot, is there a machine somewhere that can serve for
</I>&gt;<i> this?
</I>
Not yet, let's talk about this in the Meeting on Tuesday. I was thinking about trying to leverage Amazon + Windows.

&gt;<i> To have a Windows buildbot I'd need a Windows machine - shall I
</I>&gt;<i> just start on a bunch of virtual machines and we'll sort it out later
</I>&gt;<i> or is there something in place for that already?
</I>
Yep, I was thinking virtual machines somehow, but let me know what you think is best.

&gt;<i> - I've been getting some mails / im's from people who are interested
</I>&gt;<i> in using Mapnik on Windows, and php_mapnik, and are starting to find
</I>&gt;<i> my wiki page on it. So that's encouraging :) I'm hoping to attract
</I>&gt;<i> more users with some introduction articles for various websites.
</I>
Nice!


&gt;<i> So I
</I>&gt;<i> was wondering, does anyone have a simple but nice map that is rendered
</I>&gt;<i> with Mapnik, with a small and free data set, that I can use for
</I>&gt;<i> demonstration purposes? The examples on the Mapnik website are OK but
</I>&gt;<i> either complicated or very specialized, I'd like to find an example
</I>&gt;<i> that needs only a few layers and appeals to a wide audience.
</I>
I would recommend re-sending an email *just* about this request so people are more likely to see it than down here :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
