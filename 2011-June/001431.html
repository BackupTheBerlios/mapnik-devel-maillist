<PRE>Quick correction to my previous mail:
The Linux x86_64 library is now about 261KB.  Something I did last night
must have changed that dramatically... not quite sure what.

&gt;<i> Hi Dane,
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback.  If there are no other objections and if no one
</I>&gt;<i> else gets to it first, I can look through the build scripts to try to find

</I>&gt;<i> I may not get to it right away though because I am trying to land the work

</I>&gt;<i> Mapnik has come a long way in a short period of time.  The third party
</I>&gt;<i> evolution of language bindings is a testament to that.  I am interested in
</I>&gt;<i> the opinion of whether these eventually go into the core mapnik distro or
</I>&gt;<i> not.  Purely from the perspective of conserving size, baking the JNI
</I>&gt;<i> bindings into the core would save a fair chunk of compiled size.  Currently
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux x86_64 JNI library is about 650KB and isn't fully implemented.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think this is due to the fact that all of the inline code and templates get
</I>&gt;<i> instantiated in each shared library as weak symbols, just to be ignored
</I>&gt;<i> later.  The actual unique code that goes into the binding is pretty small.
</I>&gt;<i>  It's also pretty straightforward to build: Just one CPP file and a handful
</I>&gt;<i> of compiler flags that are determined by java-config.  It would be pretty
</I>&gt;<i> easy to drop into the core distribution as an optional component to be built
</I>&gt;<i> if Java headers are present, but I'm going back and forth on my own opinion
</I>&gt;<i> as to whether it should be in core or separate.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Mapnik developers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In conjunction with a project I'm working on, I've been building out some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JNI bindings for mapnik.  They are here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni">https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At some point, I'd like to discuss merging this into the core mapnik
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project where I think such things belong, but for now, I've stumbled across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a minor mystery.  The bindings work perfectly on OSX and fail miserably on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linux.  I'm so used to shared library weirdness on OSX, that I was a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit surprised by this since Linux is usually the well behaved citizen in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this regard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After an evening of digging I ran across several related threads.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most pertinent is here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gis.638310.n2.nabble.com/libtool-Error-when-loading-input-plugins-from-shared-library-td5176657.html">http://gis.638310.n2.nabble.com/libtool-Error-when-loading-input-plugins-from-shared-library-td5176657.html</A> but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it was never resolved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The issue specifically is that I have a shared library libmapnik-jni.so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that contains the JNI exports and depends on libmapnik2.so.  Everything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works fine until attempting to load an input plugin.  Upon calling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> datasource_cache::register_datasources(...), the following type of message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is written to stderr:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Problem loading plugin library: /usr/local/lib/mapnik2/input/sqlite.input
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (dlopen failed - plugin likely has an unsatisfied dependency or incompatible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ABI)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then, when calling datasource_cache::create with parameters referencing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> postgis plugin, the following is written and the process crashes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/bin/java: symbol lookup error:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /usr/local/lib/mapnik2/input/postgis.input: undefined symbol:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _ZN6mapnik5box2dIdEC1Ev
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Depending on the load order and such different messages and failures can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occur but these are the gist of it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While tracking this down, the first thing I noticed was that if I defined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libmapnik2.so prior to running the Java process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that does all of this, everything works.  This led me to look at the plugins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves and I noticed that the input plugins do not have a library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependency on libmapnik2.so.  On OSX they do because things can't be left
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partially linked on that platform, but on Linux mapnik must be assuming that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in order for a plugin to load, the libmapnik2.so library must already be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loaded globally.  To test this, I ran the script here in the plugin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni/blob/master/fixup-input-plugins.sh">https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni/blob/master/fixup-input-plugins.sh</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This just renames each .input file and links a new one that depends on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original and libmapnik2.so.  With this done, everything works as it should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and no warnings are printed when the plugins are loaded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe that the issue is that on the JVM, when a library is loaded (via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System.load or its cousin System.loadLibrary), dlopen is being called on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> library without the RTLD_GLOBAL flag.  This is probably a good thing as it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keeps name collisions to a minimum in JNI libraries.  However, it means that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when libmapnik2.so goes to dlopen() its input plugins, it results in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> undefined symbols because even though the libmapnik2.so library is resident
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the process, its symbols have not been exported for all to use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I were to file a bug against mapnik, it would be titled &quot;Input plugins
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fail to load when libmapnik2.so loaded via dlopen call without RTLD_GLOBAL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flag&quot;.  There are several solutions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Include libmapnik2.so as a dependency in mapnik input plugins,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar to how my script fixes things up to be after the fact.  This would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mirror OSX behavior and I do not believe it would have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any deleterious effects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Declare that libmapnik2.so can only be used when explicitly linked to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or via a dlopen(RTLD_GLOBAL) call.  This would mean that it will never work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when loaded directly or indirectly by standard JVMs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Leave it to someone else (me).  In this case, I suppose I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dlopen the JNI library again with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag prior to loading any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugins.  The man page says this should work.  Of course, I'd have to find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the full path to the shared library, which I don't necessarily know, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this introduces more failure paths and is a little bit crazy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unless if anyone is aware of some issue that I don't know about, I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first option is the best.  It would mean that mapnik would always be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to load its input plugins regardless of how itself was loaded.  I'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at all familiar with the mapnik build process to know where to make this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change, however.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RE: JNI bindings in general - wow. As little as a year ago the Mapnik
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project just had Python bindings. Now we have emerging bindings for PHP [1],
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NodeJS [2], Ruby [3], and Java. So, its a good time to re-assess and discuss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both how development of bindings can be optimal (inside/outside core,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release cycle, etc), and any changes we need to make in core to make life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good for various bindings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RE: plugin linking, your analysis is spot on. Of your three solutions, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also agree that we should likely move to #1 - actually linking any required
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependencies such that plugins can be loaded without having to monkey with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dlopen flags. The reason we have resisted doing this so far is that Python
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has an easy mechanism to control dlopen flags [4]. But, I noticed the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem as you hit with NodeJS recently [5]. My workaround on linux is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dlopen libmapnik.so first [6], which of course is an ugly hack. But it works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well enough I've forgotten to circle back on this issue, till now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, if we go with solution #1, to make Linux linking like OSX, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution is pretty easy. We just need to find all the linking lines in each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plugin build file that are specific to Darwin and make them apply no matter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform (we only currently support linux, freebsd, solaris, and osx with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the SCons scripts).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An example of that would be here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/browser/trunk/plugins/input/shape/SConscript#L42">http://trac.mapnik.org/browser/trunk/plugins/input/shape/SConscript#L42</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Artem, others hav comments/drawbacks of this on Linux? I know Fedora
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recently changed their policy to be more like OSX. I can't see any drawbacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of this approach. It just needs a bit of testing I think.
