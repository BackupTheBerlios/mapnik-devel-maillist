<PRE>Thanks for your feedback! Yes the plan is to offer precompiled
binaries too, but there are some issues that prevent this from being a
one-stop solution:

- It's only feasible for dll's that export a C interface. C++
libraries cannot be offered (realistically) pre-compiled, because one
would have to offer it for each compiler version and with each
combination of preprocessor flags (_BIND_TO_CURRENT_CRT_VERSION,
__CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS, SECURE_SCL, iterator debugging, ...)
- It only works for dll's, not static libraries (for the same reason)
- Depending on one's environment setup, it may be easier to build
everything from one solution.
- Source patching: not all packages build out of the box on Windows,
some assume that the autotools generate certain files (like config.h).
To not have to require developers to install Cygwin just to get those
files generated, one would have to either provide a fully working
source tree for the dependencies, or offer patches to get the
libraries to work. The former approach isn't very good imo because it
requires a lot of duplication of effort and undermines the 'single
source' principle, where people can trust one single source for
getting their code. So I'm taking the second approach, which also is
easier from a division of labor point of view (less communication and
commits just for Windows support required). As a side note, I'm quite
frustrated by the FSF's juvenile approach to distribution - it seems
like they're purposely making it harder than necessary to use VS to
build their libraries. Now it's possible to side step it but still, a
more pragmatic approach would help a lot of people. Alternatively, I
hope the community can move away from their libraries as soon as
replacements are sufficiently wide spread - for example a Boost
version of libdl and ICU instead of iconv.

Regarde SideBySide, frankly I'm ignoring that for now. I'm assuming
(from what I've seen in the wild) that people will use an App-Local
deployment model anyway.Of course the approach I'm following would
allow for the automatic generation of MSI fragments which could lead
to more sharing of binaries between applications in the future, but
I'm not implementing that for now, as I think it's out of the scope of
this GSoC project. Getting that right requires all developers to have
a quite detailed understanding of Windows deployment issues anyway,
and considering that even something as primitive as NSIS is still
widely used throughout the Windows OSS world, I think it's fair to say
that that knowledge isn't widely spread. But again the automatic
vsproject generation I'm working on could provide a framework to
abstract all of that away for developers, and could enable a very
small amount of people to provide high-quality installers for a large
amount of applications with very little work.

cheers,

roel
