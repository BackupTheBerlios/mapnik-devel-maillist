<PRE>Hi Mapnik developers,
In conjunction with a project I'm working on, I've been building out some
JNI bindings for mapnik.  They are here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni">https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni</A>

At some point, I'd like to discuss merging this into the core mapnik project
where I think such things belong, but for now, I've stumbled across a minor
mystery.  The bindings work perfectly on OSX and fail miserably on Linux.
 I'm so used to shared library weirdness on OSX, that I was a little bit
surprised by this since Linux is usually the well behaved citizen in this
regard.

After an evening of digging I ran across several related threads.  The most
pertinent is here:
<A HREF="http://gis.638310.n2.nabble.com/libtool-Error-when-loading-input-plugins-from-shared-library-td5176657.html">http://gis.638310.n2.nabble.com/libtool-Error-when-loading-input-plugins-from-shared-library-td5176657.html</A>
but
it was never resolved.

The issue specifically is that I have a shared library libmapnik-jni.so that
contains the JNI exports and depends on libmapnik2.so.  Everything works
fine until attempting to load an input plugin.  Upon calling
datasource_cache::register_datasources(...), the following type of message
is written to stderr:

Problem loading plugin library: /usr/local/lib/mapnik2/input/sqlite.input
(dlopen failed - plugin likely has an unsatisfied dependency or incompatible
ABI)

Then, when calling datasource_cache::create with parameters referencing a
postgis plugin, the following is written and the process crashes:

/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/bin/java: symbol lookup error:
/usr/local/lib/mapnik2/input/postgis.input: undefined symbol:
_ZN6mapnik5box2dIdEC1Ev


Depending on the load order and such different messages and failures can
occur but these are the gist of it.

While tracking this down, the first thing I noticed was that if I defined
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libmapnik2.so prior to running the Java process
that does all of this, everything works.  This led me to look at the plugins
themselves and I noticed that the input plugins do not have a library
dependency on libmapnik2.so.  On OSX they do because things can't be left
partially linked on that platform, but on Linux mapnik must be assuming that
in order for a plugin to load, the libmapnik2.so library must already be
loaded globally.  To test this, I ran the script here in the plugin
directory:
<A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni/blob/master/fixup-input-plugins.sh">https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni/blob/master/fixup-input-plugins.sh</A>

This just renames each .input file and links a new one that depends on the
original and libmapnik2.so.  With this done, everything works as it should
and no warnings are printed when the plugins are loaded.

I believe that the issue is that on the JVM, when a library is loaded (via
System.load or its cousin System.loadLibrary), dlopen is being called on the
library without the RTLD_GLOBAL flag.  This is probably a good thing as it
keeps name collisions to a minimum in JNI libraries.  However, it means that
when libmapnik2.so goes to dlopen() its input plugins, it results in
undefined symbols because even though the libmapnik2.so library is resident
in the process, its symbols have not been exported for all to use.

If I were to file a bug against mapnik, it would be titled &quot;Input plugins
fail to load when libmapnik2.so loaded via dlopen call without RTLD_GLOBAL
flag&quot;.  There are several solutions:
   - Include libmapnik2.so as a dependency in mapnik input plugins, similar
to how my script fixes things up to be after the fact.  This would mirror
OSX behavior and I do not believe it would have any deleterious effects.
   - Declare that libmapnik2.so can only be used when explicitly linked to
or via a dlopen(RTLD_GLOBAL) call.  This would mean that it will never work
when loaded directly or indirectly by standard JVMs.
   - Leave it to someone else (me).  In this case, I suppose I could dlopen
the JNI library again with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag prior to loading any
plugins.  The man page says this should work.  Of course, I'd have to find
the full path to the shared library, which I don't necessarily know, and
this introduces more failure paths and is a little bit crazy.

Unless if anyone is aware of some issue that I don't know about, I think the
first option is the best.  It would mean that mapnik would always be able to
load its input plugins regardless of how itself was loaded.  I'm not at all
familiar with the mapnik build process to know where to make this change,
however.
