Great, I've not heard of someone building on OpenBSD (only FreeBSD),  
but it should be able to work, so hopefully we can get a write up on  
the wiki once we resolve your problems.

&gt;<i> I have already written a ksh script to create symlinks for all the

</I>
Can you say more about this? Also, how did you install the dependencies?

&gt;<i> I have attached the config.log from the python scons/scons.py  
</I>&gt;<i> configure command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the errors seem to need the stdc++ library.
</I>
Yes, these are odd errors indicating that the dependencies you've  
built are experiencing linking problems.

Essentially the build system Mapnik uses runs a test compile of tiny  
application to see if the dependent libraries can be compiled and  
linked and this happens before any Mapnik libraries are involved.

I'm sorry I'm not very familiar with BSD systems, but on debian linux  
this would likely be solved by doing

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

or pointing to wherever your libraries are located that the  
depedencies, like libcairomm are using.

But, regarding cairo,cairo,pycairo, these are optional dependencies  
for Mapnik and can be disabled during the build by running

$ python scons/scons.py CAIRO=False

which I would recommend doing. You can also re-enable the Cairo  
support later.

&gt;<i>  How can libcairomm be fixed?
</I>
See, above. I would simple disable it. But it appears that other  
libraries also may have problems within this SCons checking, so using  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH may help.

&gt;<i> There are also some mutex errors.
</I>&gt;<i> Could pthread be enabled for OpenBSD in the same way it is enabled  
</I>&gt;<i> for FreeBSD in SConstuct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You bet. Just modify the scons lines...


     if env['PLATFORM'] == 'FreeBSD':
         thread_suffix = ''
         env.Append(LIBS = 'pthread')


.... to also support OpenBSD, and let us know what the proper way to  
detect the platform is.

&gt;<i> Please can you provide me with some pointers on how to get mapnik  
</I>&gt;<i> working on OpenBSD.
</I>
Also, I would recommend building Mapnik 0.7.0 instead of 0.6.1.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could a buildbot be set up for openbsd?
</I>
Yes, surely. That would be great. We have an active buildbot and we  
could set your machine up as a slave. Let's do this once you get  
things built properly.
