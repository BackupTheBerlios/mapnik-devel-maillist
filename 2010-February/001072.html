<PRE>Hi Erlo,

It looks like your boost library was built without thread support, as  
the error you are getting is coming from a config header that says:

#ifndef BOOST_CONFIG_HPP
#  include &lt;boost/config.hpp&gt;
#endif

#if defined(BOOST_DISABLE_THREADS)

So, I think you either need to rebuild boost with threading support,  
or compile Mapnik without threading support.

If you read the last email I send to Brad closely you'll notice that  
he found a few places in the Mapnik library where we don't properly  
avoid the use of boost::thread::mutux if threading is disabled. So you  
may run into a few small compile errors when actually compiling  
Mapnik, but we can fix these easily.


So, what I think you need to do is rerun Scons like:

$ python scons/scons.py THEADING=single

And that should bypass the configure check for boost_threads which  
appears to be the main problem.

A few comments also below.

Okay, good to know. Part of why I am asking is so that, in the future,  
it might be easier for me to try to replicate. I've not used OpenBSD  
before, but if you could spare me the kindness of pasting some of your  
basic setup commands (like we have for Ubuntu at <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/UbuntuInstallation">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/UbuntuInstallation</A>) 
, that would be very helpful. I can't promise that I'll get it is  
soon, but it would be good to have available.

Okay, sounds good.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately the threading errors from mutex.hpp still remain, even

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, so far this is just related to two things, boost and the way our  
SCons scripts check for dependencies. The SCons approach is to compile  
a tiny C or C++ program and make sure it runs. This both indicates  
when a dependency is missing and not configured right (or well enough  
to compile). The problem with this method however is that we have to  
make sure that the proper compile flags are sent not only to the  
formal compile of Mapnik (when you get there) but also to these  
dependency checks.

In this case I think that your boost is not compiled with thread  
support. And even if it were, it sounds like we need to send the same  
flags as were used to compile boost, which appears custom on *BSD  
systems, and from googling around indicates need to be pulled from the  
env variables:

$PTHREAD_LIBS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS

from: <A HREF="http://wiki.freebsd.org/BoostPortingProject">http://wiki.freebsd.org/BoostPortingProject</A>

Do you have these variables on OpenBSD?

&gt;<i> I can solve the &#8220;Compiler threading support is not turned on&#8221; error  
</I>&gt;<i> by replacing the &#8220;requires_threads.hpp&#8221; include with  
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;posix_features.hpp&#8221; in the  /usr/local/include/boost/thread/detail/ 
</I>&gt;<i> config.hpp file but the other errors still remain. I do not know  
</I>&gt;<i> whether the replacement is correct.
</I>
I would avoid doing this. Make sure to revert this change and get a  
correct build of boost going before trying to build Mapnik.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have attached the config.log and a verbose output file.
