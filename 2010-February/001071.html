<PRE>Hi Dane,

Thanks for responding.  I've compiled some information here regarding our threading problem.  Our application, CdmMap, aborts when it tries to initialize the Object Request Broker (ORB) in the call CORBA::ORB_init.  This is the first step towards using CORBA based interprocess communications.  I obtained a stack trace from the core dump:

Notice that a segment violation occurred in pthread_mutex_lock.  Since we are using an older single threaded version of mico, I decided to see if I could remove threading from mapnik to resolve this problem.

I used the &quot;nm&quot; command to check for threading within the mapnik library:

There are many references to &quot;pthread_mutex*&quot;.  So I decided to rebuild mapnik.  The first step was to rebuild the boost library without threading.  I used the following commands:

$ ./bootstrap.sh --with-icu=/opt/icu --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python \
        --prefix=/opt/boost \
        --with-libraries=system,filesystem,regex,iostreams,python,program_options

$ ./bjam -d+2 threading=single install | tee bjamInstall.log

This is different from the first build in that I removed &quot;thread&quot; from the -with-libraries list and added &quot;threading-single&quot; to the bjam command.

I was unsuccessful in getting scons to build mapnik under HP-UX.  I decided to forgo becoming a scons expert and attempted to work around it.  I entered the command &quot;python scons/scons.py -i install&quot; and saved all output to a file (&quot;-i&quot; make it proceed in case of errors).  I converted the file to a build script and was able to modify all the compile and link commands so they worked.

To build mapnik without threading, I removed &quot;-pthread&quot;, &quot;-DBOOST_SPIRIT_THREADSAFE&quot;, and &quot;-DMAPNIK_THREADSAFE&quot; from the compile commands, and &quot;/opt/boost/lib/libboost_thread.so&quot; from the link command.  I also modified font_engine_freetype.hpp and placement_finder.cpp to add &quot;#ifdef MAPNIK_THREADSAFE  . . .  #endif&quot; statements to bracket out some thread references.  Your developers may want to make this change as well.

However, I was not successful in removing all thread references as the following command illustrates:

$ nm libmapnik.sl.0.7.0 | grep mutex

I believe I may need to take another look at boost to see where threading is still referenced.

There are some other things of which you should be aware.  In order to build boost and mapnik, I needed to install the gnu compiler.  Until working with mapnik, we had been using the HP-UX aCC compiler for all our software.  In the case of mapnik applications, we are mixing modules from different compilers in our executables.  However, I had no trouble creating a test program which reads PostGIS map data and displays it in a window on-screen.  Boost, mapnik, and a mapnik interface module were all compiled with g++, whereas the main module was compiled with aCC.  Only when adding mico does the problem occur.

I plan to take a look at your suggestion &quot;python scons/scons.py THREADING=single install&quot; later today.  However, I first wanted you to get the above information today.  [I'm assuming you are on central European time.  I'm in the U.S. mountain time zone.]

Hopefully I've given you everything you asked for.  Again, thanks for the support.

Sincerely,
Brad

Hi Brad,

I've not used mico before, but it would be helpful if you could provide some simple sample code that triggers the problem.

Regarding Mapnik and threading, mapnik supports essentially two compile-times modes, one threadsafe(&quot;multi&quot;) and one not (&quot;single&quot;).

To rebuild without multi-threading support do:

python scons/scons.py THREADING=single install

This will removing linking to boost_thread and the use of mutexes. Looking at the build scripts, it appears that (on linux) this does not remove the linking to lpthread, so you may also need to comment that out on line 914 of SConstruct (pthread = '-pthread').

Could you paste the whole backtrace?

Also, would be good to cc' back to mapnik-devel if you are okay with that.

Dane

Dane,

Changing the subject entirely, how do you build Mapnik without threads?  The reason I'm asking is the program I'm building also uses mico for interprocess communications.  The program aborts immediately as mico tries to initialize.  The core dump shows a segment violation in /usr/lib/libpthread.1 with the stack trace back to CORBA::ORB_init.  So I think it may be best to remove thread support from Mapnik, since changing the old single threaded version of mico here is going to affect a lot of other people.  Any suggestions?

Ah, I see.

So the 'C++ signature' thing is automatically generated by boost::python's docstring methods and refers to the python function only, which is load_map_from_string. Mapnik's python bindings are written in C++, which is why that appears that way.

As such there is nothing to change in the docstring, only the possibility to change the actual function names to match between the python bindings and the C++ core library. I think this is something we could consider doing in the 0.8 as it is going to have other backwards incompatible changes.

Dane,

Yes, I was looking at the Python API docs since I couldn't find C++ documentation.  However, docs/api_docs/python/mapnik_mapnik-module.html file lists a &quot;C++ signature&quot; for each function.  This is what I was looking at.  Perhaps this is the best place to make a change.

Hi Brad,

Right, I see that our naming is different between python and C++, which although not ideal, does happen in a variety of cases. Are you looking at the Python API docs?

<A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/806">https://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/806</A>

I'm not aware of this function being documented in any C++ api docs. Where might you suggest fixing the documentation?

Dane,

Thanks for working this issue for me.

I ran into a problem using load_map_from_string in a C++ program.  Evidently, I needed to use &quot;load_map_string&quot; as specified in load_map.hpp.  Is there a problem with the documentation?  Perhaps a documentation correction could also be rolled into v0.7.0.

Brad,

You are welcome, thanks again for the report and the further info.

Also, as followup, the fix is now in trunk and I've created further tickets to flag investigating impacts on other database drivers:

<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/514">http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/514</A>

We've yet to set a date for Mapnik 0.7.1 but this fix will be backported when we branch for that bugfix release, and tested further.

Subject: Re: [Mapnik-devel] Mapnik v0.7.0 PostGis Big Endian problem

Hi Brad,

Thanks very much for this report. I think I am the only Mapnik
developer that has had access to a big endian machine to test on. I
have thus far only focused on adding support for shapefiles and fixing
various rendering problems.

After seeing your report I set up a postgres testing environment and
confirmed this problem and also confirmed that your fix works on my
big endian system without causing any regressions on little endian
testing setups that i have (ubuntu 9.10 64bit and os x 10.5 32 bit).

My sense is that the #ifndef should have been removed when we added an
explicit native endianess flag to the AsBinary() function when pulling
geometries from Postgis: <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1190.">http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1190.</A> But
I'll need to look a bit closer to be sure.

Either way I have created a ticket <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/515">http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/515</A>
to trac this issue and have put that in the cue to fix asap.

Thanks,

Dane

Mapnik developers,

Please be aware that the PostGIS interface does not work on machines
with big endian architectures.  I had to modify wkb.cpp in order to
get this to work.

Here is what I learned by debugging this problem.  The PostGIS
plugin obtains the result set from the database server in an XDR
format (by design).  Inside wkb.cpp, the wkb_reader routine
determines no byte swapping is necessary by setting needSwap_ = 0.
This causes routines such as read_integer to call read_int32_ndr
(instead of read_int32_xdr), and read_double to call read_double_ndr
(instead of read_double_xdr).  I found the read_[int32|double]_[ndr|
xdr] routines in global.hpp.  The read_int32_ndr and read_double_ndr
performed the expected but unnecessary byte swapping.  Since the
database result set was in an XDR format, converting it to NDR made
the values incompatible with the big endian cpu.

To resolve this problem, I modified the lines:
#ifndef MAPNIK_BIG_ENDIAN
    needSwap_=byteOrder_?wkbXDR:wkbNDR;
#else
    needSwap_=byteOrder_?wkbNDR:wkbXDR;
#endif
within wkb_reader to be:
//#ifndef MAPNIK_BIG_ENDIAN
    needSwap_=byteOrder_?wkbXDR:wkbNDR;
//#else
//   needSwap_=byteOrder_?wkbNDR:wkbXDR;
//#endif
This had the effect of setting needSwap_ to true, calling
read_int32_xdr and read_double_xdr (instead of read_int32_ndr and
read_double_ndr), but ultimately no byte swapping is performed.
Thus I could process PostGIS data in my application.

Please reply, comment on my change, and let me know what the long
term solution should be.  Also, please test mapnik and supported
plugins on big endian machines prior to future software releases.

Sincerely,
Brad Simpson
