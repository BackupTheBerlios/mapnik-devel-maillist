<PRE>Hi Brad,

</I>&gt;<i> Good suggestion about building under Linux to see if the same

</I>
Okay, good to know.

&gt;<i> In fact, we may not have the source to Mico v2.3.7 in order to build  
</I>&gt;<i> it under Linux.  [Mico was supplied to us on our HP-UX systems pre- 
</I>&gt;<i> built.]  Perhaps I can find it on the web.  We are going to have a  
</I>&gt;<i> meeting Monday, however, to discuss upgrading to a newer  
</I>&gt;<i> multithreaded version of Mico.  So all of this may be overcome by  
</I>&gt;<i> events.
</I>
Okay, I hope that these possibilities can help you out.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding using SCons to build Mapnik under HP-UX, unfortunately I  
</I>&gt;<i> lost the notes on the modifications to the SCons directories [over  
</I>&gt;<i> zealous during code cleanup].  I had to make changes to various  
</I>&gt;<i> files in the scons/scons-local-1.2.0/SCons area.  Even though the  
</I>&gt;<i> gnu compiler was installed, scons was trying to use the aCC compiler.
</I>
Ah, okay, this sounds similar to SCons bug that I've also seen affect  
Solaris. In the future you could try installing the latest SCons on  
your system and then instead of running the &quot;local&quot; scons just do:

scons configure &amp;&amp; scons install

Our local copy is just for convenience and perhaps the latest scons  
sources have addressed this issue.

&gt;<i> I fixed the compiler choice, but the arguments for compilation and  
</I>&gt;<i> linking had unrecognized options.
</I>
Okay, which may be a problem with some of the flags in our Scons  
implementation specific to Mapnik.

&gt;<i>   After playing with it for a bit and getting frustrated, I finally  
</I>&gt;<i> decided to build with the ignore errors options.  I  saved all the  
</I>&gt;<i> commands into a file, made group edits, and ended up with a working  
</I>&gt;<i> build script.  I can send a copy of this script if desired.
</I>
Sure, it would be a good reference at the least. I won't  have access  
to an HP-UX machine to test anytime soon, but perhaps others might  
benefit.

Dane
