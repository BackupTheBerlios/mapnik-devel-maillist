<PRE>Hey mapnikers,

  So the nice rainy sunday prompted me to resume my trials with
mapnik. I was able to build the latest SVN against the ubuntu 6.04
boost libraries and everything went well. Alot has changed since the
tutorial on the website and that threw me off for a few minutes until
I found the excellent demo script! Beautiful cartography. Beautiful
python.

 I have also been working a bit evaluating python web application
frameworks and cherrypy impressed me with it's ease of use and very
&quot;pythonic&quot; approach.

 So putting the two together, I worked up a simple pseudo-WMS server
as an interface to mapnik. I say pseudo-WMS server because it doesn't
even come close to complying with the WMS spec. The only thing it can
do is handle a simple GetMap request:
 <A HREF="http://localhost:8080/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;LAYERS=states&amp;FORMAT=image/jpeg&amp;SRS=EPSG:4326&amp;STYLES=&amp;BBOX=-120,15,-70,65&amp;width=400&amp;height=400">http://localhost:8080/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;LAYERS=states&amp;FORMAT=image/jpeg&amp;SRS=EPSG:4326&amp;STYLES=&amp;BBOX=-120,15,-70,65&amp;width=400&amp;height=400</A>

But for some very simple WMS clients, this is all you need. I set up a
nifty little interactive map using wms-map
(<A HREF="http://wms-map.sourceforge.net/">http://wms-map.sourceforge.net/</A>)  which I'll make public as soon as I
get mapnik installed on a server somewhere.

Cherrypy servers run as standalone servers bound to a specific port
but can optionally be put behind an apache server... Setting up this
WMS server as a standalone should be fairly simple. You'll need the
cherrypy and mapnik python modules to start. There is a createMap()
function that contains all the usual mapnik code which you can tweak
for your specific data. Then there is a WMS class that parses the WMS
requests and passes them off to createMap() which writes an image to
disk and returns the map image to the client. I didn't have alot of
time to spend so this only a proof-of-concept.

My initial testing against a Mapserver-based WMS (running on the same
machine, same dataset) indicates that for single requests, Mapserver
is only about 15% faster. But for many simultaneous requests (such as
the tiled WMS clients make; 9 requests on every pan) mapnik/cherrypy
is 3-400% faster (!!) under a decent load. Put this behind an apache
server and you could have a fast, solid WMS server with mapnik on the
backend. Plus mapnik's image quality is by far the most impressive of
any map rendering engine i've seen! Here's a screenshot comparing the
WMS clients based on both mapserver and mapnik -
<A HREF="http://perrygeo.net/img/mapserver_mapnik.png">http://perrygeo.net/img/mapserver_mapnik.png</A> (a screenshot of one of
my favorite places in the world. any guesses??). Just look at that
beautiful line work.. did I mention I was impressed?

Attached is the code. Please give the prototype WMS server a shot and
let me know how it goes.  My understanding of both mapnik and cherrypy
is limited so please jump in and make suggestions.
