Hi Joseph,

You should not need to change the paths in the 'paths.py' file, those  
simply help the python bindings pull in the dll's for specific  
datasources.

	GIS
Message-ID: <47F58E85-C1BA-4066-90DF-AEEBD40DFD77@hailmail.net>

Mapnik Users -

I'd like to announce the first public release of Quantumnik.

This plugin allows QGIS (http://qgis.org/) to be used to style and  
render Mapnik maps on-the-fly and for xml mapfile export.

There is also basic support for loading (but not parsing) existing XML  
for dynamic browsing.

Wiki and source is at:
http://bitbucket.org/springmeyer/quantumnik/

Screencasts for installation and usage can be found at:
http://dbsgeo.com/

The latest release can be downloaded from:
http://qgis.dbsgeo.com/

Thanks to Jay D. for early testing.

Cheers,

Dane Springmeyer

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Boost minimum Version
Message-ID: <FC6975C4-B140-4B99-992B-D06066E76B7F@hailmail.net>

We currently list Boost 1.33 as the minimum version for Mapnik.

I've not been successful getting 1.33 to compile with Mapnik, likely  
do to boost bugs, but I'm not fully sure.

Anyone have issue with bumping the minimum version to 1.34? At 1.34,  
boost reorganized and added to the filesystem headers and sticking to  
this layout will make things cleaner on the Mapnik side.

But,  adding/maintaining a few workarounds to maintain 1.33 support  
should not be terribly hard. Anyone feel strongly that we should (this  
being for the next 0.6.1/0.7.0 release)?

Also, anyone know what makes Mapnik incompatible with boost 1.32?

I have an existing git repo set up to pull from svn://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/

This used to work, but now I'm finding the svn protocol is broken or disabled.

http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/ still works, but since git doesn't have a
command to switch/relocate svn sources, I'd prefer not to recreate the
git repo just to switch to it.

Why did svn:// get disabled, and can we enable it again?

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Mapnik split
Message-ID: <20090610011212.1b763b90@frodo.mittelerde>

Hello,

I'm currently compiling Mapnik again after some autotools updates -
since 20 minutes. Currently Mapnik has grown to a beast and the boost
dependency does the rest.

To shorten the compile time and also the complexness of the build
system I would propose this split: (one for an own package)

- bindings (python)
- agg
- scons
- sources (maybe split to internal/external API)
- plugins (I would propose one package for all)
- tinyxml

Think about utils/demo/test?

This is only a raw idea. But in general, What do you think this idea?

regards
Andreas

Andreas,

Honestly, I don't understand what you are proposing. The codebase is  
already broken out much as you propose and with SCons, at least, it  
quite easy to just build or rebuild a portion.

I don't think many people compile the Mapnik codebase very frequently,  
and I don't find it any slower now than in the past.

It would probably be better to refactor the existing codebase to remove as
much as possible from the header files.
At present many of the header files include large portions of code and have
a lot of includes, which is probably the major reason compiling takes a long
time.

Hey all,

I want to send a big thanks out to Dominic Lowe for such great work on  
packaging Mapnik for Debian.

His quick work after the 0.6.0 has now paid off for Ubuntu, as Mapnik  
0.6.0 has been accepted into Ubuntu Karmic, the upcoming release.  
Thanks to Christophe Sauthier, Andres Rodriguez, and likely many  
others who helped make this happen.

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+source/mapnik/0.6.0-1ubuntu1

This means you can now be using either python25 or python26 on ubuntu  
and be able to do:

$ apt-get install python-mapnik

Amazing. Don't you wish you could do that on macosx and windows?

Cheers,

Dane

Except the "though" part makes a mess of it :(

Maybe the ability to do a simple substitution in the querystring would
suffice:
"SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE my_geom && %(bbox)s"

%(bbox)s gets replaced with st_geomfromtext('POLYGON(( ... ))', 1234)

Make it substitutable multiple times, and if people are doing clever
[stupid] things with projections (like i do) then they can always wrap it in
st_setsrid() or st_transform() or whatever they need.

Improvements? What am i missing?

Rob :)

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] OSX builds with XCode in SVN
Message-ID: <11FACF64-F77A-4F45-8E2C-51E93F45F127@hailmail.net>

Mapnik-dev,

I'm planning to begin work on a macosx-specific build system using the  
XCode IDE,  The goal behind this is to facilitate more control over  
the compilation and linking of mapnik and eventually pave a trail  
towards Universal Framework builds of Mapnik. For those of you not  
familiar with OSX Frameworks, essentially its a bundling of the  
dynamic library along with its supporting data and files in a single  
directory, usually placed in '/Library/Frameworks'.

To this end, and since this is likely to be a long project, I'm  
thinking about adding this to the mapnik svn repository.

I'm thinking, if there is support and interest for this, I'd place the  
working files in:

http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/osx

And when we make releases, this folder (along with the autotools  
stuff) should be stripped from the tagged release to avoid confusion,  
since SCons should be the singular tool for builds for most users.

So, can I get a vote +1 / -1 from devs on whether to include this in  
mapnik svn, or whether to keep separate?

Thanks,
Dane

Hi all,

I have a nice mapnik layer of which the results are visible under 
http://fietscomfort.openstreetmap.be/?zoom=16&lat=51.21213&lon=4.42138&layers=B0TFTFT

something strangs happens to some of the calculated numbers in the comfort 
tiles, where the rounding clearly does not work properly. example:

http://fietscomfort.openstreetmap.be/fietsroutes-comfort/16/33572/21878.png

the rendering of the numbers is based a style and the layer declarations , 
which follow below.

any hint on the reasons for the round function not always working as 
expected? maybe there are alternative ways to accomplish the same, 
suggestions are welcome, since this is about the most complex query i've 
written so far :)

bye,
ivom

Message-ID: <d65fceb50906280805v3848ba40y5128cd5fbfe5b30a@mail.gmail.com>

Guys I?m sorry if this is the wrong forum(if it is wrong just reply "wrong
one dude"),Here goes,
I am running osm2pgsql and I get the following:
(by the way the .osm file I am using is uncompressed)

osm2pgsql SVN version 0.66-16099M

Using projection SRS 4326 (LatLong)
Setting up table: planet_osm_point
Setting up table: planet_osm_line
Setting up table: planet_osm_polygon
Setting up table: planet_osm_roads
Mid: Ram, scale=10000000

Reading in file: map.osm
error while opening file map.osm

Any help no matter how trivial will be greatly appreciated.

Well it is not exactly the right forum as osm2pgsql is not a mapnik tool 
but more of an osm tool, but hey, 90% of people here probably use it.

It sounds as if you ran something like "osm2pgsql map.osm" where map.osm 
was not in your current working directory? You have to specify the name 
of the .osm file to import on the command line, and you either have to 
give a full path spec, or it has to reside in the current directory.

Frederik
