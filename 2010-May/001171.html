<PRE>Hi all,

    I am debugging a problem in an Apache module I have written, and 
which uses Mapnik with a PostGIS data source.

I am seeing sporadic &quot;standard exception: remote end has closed 
connection unexpectedly&quot; error messages which originate from the libpq 
library. I can however verify that the PostgreSQL server processes are 
still alive and don't have any reason to complain.

I have found that the problem *only* occurs if I make multiple 
concurrent requests against my Apache server and this, in turn, leads to 
different Mapnik instances using the database at the same time.

This has me puzzled because I'm strictly multi-process; I run Apache in 
prefork mode and neither does my module do anything with threads. I 
cannot see anything in the whole design where the different Mapnik 
instances would somehow have a chance of interfering with each other's 
database connections - yet my testing points in that direction.

Does anybody have a hunch where to look? Can you think of any reason why 
two processes using Mapnik and talking to the same PostGIS database 
would somehow interfere with each other?

The mapnik::datasource_cache does not in any way operate across 
processes, does it?

Bye
Frederik
