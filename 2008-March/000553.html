cool, the stuff i've been working on has been a bit on and off for 
months (maybe 6). I did look for all the pdf rendering libraries I could 
find before I started, and looking back now, Cairo wasn't in the list. 
Not sure how I missed that.

wxPdfDoc still says its in beta (and not updated since Dec 2006), but 
had far more supported features than the other libraries I found at the 
time. Ulrich, the maintainer, is still working on it, and hoped to have 
another release with more features and bug fixes.

It should not be too much work to use whatever library you want.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I've used a patched wxPdfDoc for the pdf rendering.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Most symbolizers are implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm guessing not LinePatternSymbolizer ;-)
</I>
Only partly :), I can use a pdf pattern to render a line, but since the 
people I wrote this for didn't need it, I didn't spend the time to 
rotate the pattern for each line segment.

<A HREF="http://upload2.net/page/download/SeATQAEf9aw4LWz/linepatternsymboltest.pdf.html">http://upload2.net/page/download/SeATQAEf9aw4LWz/linepatternsymboltest.pdf.html</A>

The only other symbolizer I haven't done is the marker symbolizer. But 
the point_symbolizer with images worked well enough for me.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Tried to make it as a separate library to mapnik, but had to subclass 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some of the symbolizers. Mostly this was adding output sizes to images, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since pixels don't correspond to page measurements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have (currently) just treated cairo units (which are points
</I>&gt;<i> for PDF surfaces) as equivalent to pixels. I think that isn't
</I>&gt;<i> quite right as cairo is using points (72dpi) and mapnik assumes
</I>&gt;<i> a value of about 90dpi IIRC.
</I>
The way i've done scaling is:
  - specify the units to be used in the pdf, e.g. mm, inch, point
  - then each pixel in mapnik is equated to a pdf-unit.
  - e.g. with mm units in the pdf doc, a 5-pixel wide line corresponds 
to a 5mm wide line. This worked quite well.

It would be nice if you could specify an output size of images and get 
mapnik to scale them. At the moment its a bit of a pain that the 
symbolizer_with_image requires the size of the image before it loads it, 
it'd be nice if it figured it out itself. This would let me remove the 
subclasses; looking back now, this was probably the way I should have 
done it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Implemented PDF layers, so you can turn things on and off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't done that, but if cairo offers a way to declare layers
</I>&gt;<i> it should be easy enough - it's the first I've heard of it to be
</I>&gt;<i> honest.
</I>
It's quite easy, just some marked content in the page stream, and a 
couple of dictionaries. I had to hack support for it into wxpdfdoc 
myself, although it might be in the next release. If you want more 
information, its called 'Optional Content' in pdfs, and been available 
since PDF 1.5. The PDF Reference version 1.7 has it in section 4.10.

I'm not sure what viewers other than acrobat support it. But the 
fall-back for a viewer with no support is to just render everything.

I'll try to get a bit more work done on it this weekend, I haven't 
updated to svn head for a while.
