<PRE>Hello,I was having problems installing mapnik on my PC. I had followed the
wiki instructions to a T(atleast I thought). I had downloaded Mapnik 0.6.0
and Python 2.5. I installed Python and Mapnik 0.6.0 and set up the system
variables but I didnt get it to work. I later installed Visual Studio 6 to
but mapnik still did not work.
&#180;
How did I get this to work, I did the following:
-I uninstalled everthing(Python2.5, Visaul Studio 6 and Mapnik)-Got rid of
all the system and user variables I had set up.
I installed the following programs in order:
-Visual C++ 9
-Python 2.5 and set up the Pythonpath
-unzipped Mapnik to the correct folder nad set up both the system and user
variables.

After I did this I followed the trac wiki guide to install Mapnik and
everything worked. I am not quite sure what was wrong but I guess that the
system variables were being pointing to the wrong files and installing the
programs in the order I did and set up the system variables as I installed
the programs helped solve this.(I probably had a typo at first, who know I
just know that now it works!!!)
Take care and keep up the good work.
