Subject: [Mapnik-devel] GeoTiff output?
Message-ID: <CAKWoFMLcDsAKR0yp4gv+tLXCupP2_CKSt39q=S++PmyOpS0c9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a process where I need output images in a GeoTiff format.

Is there any plans to include geotiff support to Mapnik?
Now I have to generate images to png and convert those to geotiff with
gdal_translate.

Could I create an issue to github?


Thanks

-Lauri

Hi Lauri,

Yes, this is a reasonable feature request, and a github issue would be the right place.

Please note whether you are looking for true GeoTiff support, or just what could be accomplished with Tiff+ world file.

As you have noticed we've been moving our services around recently (mainly trac -> github). Thanks for your patience as we work things out.

This email is to alert you that we now have a new mailing list, hosted via google groups that will replace (immediately) the two current lists: mapnik-users and mapnik-devel.

You can sign up via http://mapnik.org/contact/ or directly on the groups page [1]. We DO NOT plan to auto-migrate your list subscription.

So, from now on please send emails to this single, new group: both either related to mapnik-usage or mapnik-development.

We are making this move because our current provider, berlios, plans to shut down soon [2]. There is some chance berlios will stay up, but we feel like google groups is a better option either way, and look forward to consolidating email traffic to a single list.

If you forget about this new group and accidentally send an email to mapnik-users at lists.berlios.de or mapnik-devel at lists.berlios.de, I will kindly reply reminding you of the new list. Please feel free to remind others too if you are able to respond before me. 

Thanks,

Dane

PS. we have a backup of both mailing lists as mbox files, so if/when berlios shuts down I will plan on posting viewable html archives at mapnik.org. If you are curious you can download mbox archives like:

rsync -av lists.berlios.de::mapnik-users-archive mapnik-users-archive
