Message-ID: <4D6CA03D.7080907@geoinfo.geof.hr>

Hi,

i've been deleting SPAM tickets and users as they appear. I would also 
like to propose deletion of user accounts. In the first run i'm going to 
delete users that never logged in, and after that prune users that have 
suspicious usernames like '1sensuouslady' and have no activity recorded 
on Trac.

Do you have any objections?

Dra?en

Hi Dra?en,

Thanks for helping! Yes, no objections to deleting spam accounts. I've done this in the past but its hard to keep up :)

Okay, new location for git mirror what is actually auto-updating and working is now at:

https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik2

Previous one has been removed to avoid confusion.

If you have a checkout of the old location you should be able to reset your origin like:

git rm remote origin
git add remote origin git://github.com/mapnik/mapnik2.git

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] offsets and text alignment working the wrong way
Message-ID: <AANLkTimemSwJSEcayarcOjSjbPpk8J4xQErYAKM3ozAZ@mail.gmail.com>

I found that actually (at least for the shieldsymbolizer, point
placement in v0.7) the default text alignment is working the wrong
way: if you specify a positive offset (down in y) the alignment gets
set to bottom. This is according to the specs, but it is not a good
way to do it. Depending on the number of lines your text is occupying
it will either cover the icon or not. If the default alignment would
be top, the text would never cover the icon (and the same inverted for
negative y-values).

cheers,
Martin

excuse me, this was not entirely correct, actually the
shieldsymbolizer moves on dy the whole shield (including text and
icon).

Okay, things are back up now with new reCapcha support for the trac registration stage, and spam filtering for tickets/comments.

Unfortunately spammers still get through..., but we do have smaller 
number of new user account creation, but ones that do register, spam 
freely :)

Short notice:

I've updated Akismet filtering karma from 0 to 10...

It appears that the new recapha + askismet are either not working or not good enough for fending off spam from Mapnik trac. 

I'm traveling today through next Wednesday so it's going to be tough for me to debug this further. 

Drazen and Lennard, in the meantime feel free to turn off registration if it gets too bad. You can do this by unchecking the 'registration' checkbox in the TracAccountManagerPlugin.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik1zs+MKHF5EhbwSpi0TJBCK1r0U57S3qcRsrjc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Mapnik devs!

I've been trying mapnik for render tiles from osm source and got some
crashes with segfaults.

After adding additional debug output I found what
osm_way::get_bounds() called for osm_node item from
osm_featureset.cpp:75

I'm going to continue debug, but if you have any idea you are welcome.

Vlad, yes I think I've noticed this crash in the past. Just be aware that the OSM plugin does not get a lot of use compared to the osm2pgsql/PostGIS plugin approach. So you may be better off with using PostGIS. Anyway please file a trac ticket about this issue if you want to see it fixed.

Dane, in short, OSM plugin is not thread-safe. It works fine in
single-threaded environment, but crashes with segfaults if called from
parallel threads, compiled with THREADING=multi or THREADING=single
doesn't matter.
