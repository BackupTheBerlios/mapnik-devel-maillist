<PRE>Hi all,


(I hope it's ok to mail this to -devel, I only just subscribed so I
have yet to get a feel for the audience on both lists)

I just compiled my first test program (only a modified rundemo.cpp,
really) with mapnik build from source on Windows (using vc9). It seems
to work now but it was a bit of a pain to get working to be honest, so
I figured I'd email my suggestions/remarks here before I forget them
and, if you'd like, help to improve some things in mapnik that would
make it easier for people doing so in the future. I build all required
libraries from source too, because it's usually very frustrating to
build with libraries build by someone else, especially when you want
to debug versions like I do; I realize there is no very easy way to
deal with this from a mapnik developer point of view. I made my own
project files for mapnik and the libraries that use a build system
that isn't directly supported by VS. (i.e., that nmake can't handle).
These are basically freetype and icu (and libldtl but see below for
that one).

- First, I need a 'fully' static build (i.e., all libraries linked
into one executable, including icu, all the image libraries etc). I
ended up changing config.hpp so that line 28 read
#if defined(_WINDOWS) &amp;&amp; !defined(MAPNIK_STATIC)
(i.e., I added the MAPNIK_STATIC flag) because there doesn't seem to
be a proper way to build mapnik statically on windows. I tried some
variations on defining the directives that are set there from the
build settings, but I don't see a good solution that way. I'd like to
ask to consider to add this to the mapnik source tree, in case anyone
ever wants to do again what I'm doing.

- Secondly, libldtl (I think that's what it's called, the one that
wraps dlopen()...) seems to be impossible to build on Windows without
installing the specific GNU make system. They seem to make no effort
whatsoever to support non-POSIX systems (specifically, Windows...). I
ended up patching the source so that this library is not needed at all
any more. It's just a wrapper around LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress
anyway, after all. Right now it requires a typedef for the handle type
and two or three further #ifdef sections; but even those could be
replaced with a #define, I think, so the amount of changed to the
mapnik source is very small. I'd like to ask if you'd consider going
this route directly in the mapnik source, as it would make the life of
developers using mapnik on Windows (quite a bit) easier. I don't know
the merit of this library on Linux or Unixy systems (i.e. if it's use
is worth the effort), it seems like it's just a roundabout way of
saying dlopen(), but I'm not familiar enough with that situation to
have an informed opinion. Last I heard there was work being done on a
library to be included in boost at some point that would tackle this
problem, so hopefully there'll be a library that works properly on all
platforms at some point in the future.

- Thirdly, I had to make some changes to the mapnik code to get it to
compile. They were:
* rint() doesn't exist on VC. I added one in a private header, whose
#include I #ifdef WIN32'd. Maybe boost has an implementation of this
function? I haven't checked, but if so, it may be an idea to use that
one, to be more platform-independent.
* I had to introduce some braces around calls to min/max (both in
std:: and numeric_limits). min and max are unfortunately both macros
in windows platform headers, for historical reasons, so they clash
with the use of the stl min/max functions. One way is to #undef the
macros but this can cause problems in some circumstances. There is
another, easier and less intrusive workaround, which is to change e.g.
std::max(1, 2) to (std::max)(1, 2) everywhere it's used. I realize
this looks a bit strange at first but I'd like to suggest also for
this one to consider changing this throughout the code - it's only in
a few places (8 or so max), as I understand it works on all compilers
(it should I think, but I haven't tried it), and it would allow future
users on Windows to build without modifications.
* (not really a change, but...) the order of the boost paths is
important because you use a local copy of property_tree. Is there a
reason for this? It may trip up people who don't accidentally notice a
local boost copy (I did, but like I said, only accidentally). It seems
to be from a very old copy of boost, too.

- Fourthly (and finally), I building and linking icu is a bit
involved, mostly because it needs a special data variable that is
build from various input tools. I ended up using a stub .c file from
the icu source to get it to compile, but I'm wondering if someone can
tell me what parts of icu are used by mapnik, so that I can maybe find
out if I can leave out parts of icu all together. Maybe if I try to
render a map with chinese characters that it won't work because my
program is missing this data. I can also check with the icu people if
there is an easy way to statically link this data, but if it can be
left out of the mapnik build (if it's not used), that would make it
easier for everybody I think.

Some last questions then:

- how much of all code paths in mapnik does rundemo.cpp exercise? It
only uses the shapelib driver, obviously (because that's the only one
I've build so far and it ran ;) ) but is there more functionality in
mapnik core that is not used? Is there a more comprehensive (c++) test
suite somewhere?
- is there a summary of what is new in mapnik2? Is it
'production-ready'? Will there be further 7,x releases, will there
ever be a 1.0, should I forget about the current stable and use
mapnik2?
- with the above remarks in mind, how are the win32 binaries on the
mapnik website build? Some of the above described will flat out make
it impossible to compile, so are the binaries on the website based on
a modified version?

Thanks and sorry about the long mail.


cheers,

roel
