<PRE>Hi,

    I wonder if anyone has invested some thought, or even code, into 
ways to control feature visibility depending on how much data there 
actually is.

For example, on the standard OpenStreetMap map, pubs are shown from zoom 
level 16 on. Which is ok for a place that has lots of pubs like this

<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.51502&amp;lon=-0.10676&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=M">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.51502&amp;lon=-0.10676&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=M</A>

but would it not be great for the weary traveller to know, from a much 
earlier zoom level, that the village of Thompson has a pub while nearby, 
larger, Watton doesn't?

<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=52.552&amp;lon=0.8356&amp;zoom=13&amp;layers=M">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=52.552&amp;lon=0.8356&amp;zoom=13&amp;layers=M</A>

Or, another example: If you look at the large empty triangle between the 
  towns of Gumdag, Serdar, and Gyzyletrek on this map (zoom level 9):

<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.564&amp;lon=55.331&amp;zoom=9&amp;layers=M">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=38.564&amp;lon=55.331&amp;zoom=9&amp;layers=M</A>

... you would never guess that lots of long-distance desert tracks 
criss-cross this area because they only come in at zoom level 13. And 
rightly so, because you would certainly not want the tracks on this zoom 
level 13 map to appear any sooner:

<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.3004&amp;lon=8.2687&amp;zoom=13&amp;layers=M">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.3004&amp;lon=8.2687&amp;zoom=13&amp;layers=M</A>


There are several ways how this could be handled. One is of course 
OpenStreetMap specific - simply tag the objects in question in some 
specific way and produce matching (probably quite complicated) style 
sheets.

Another way would be having region-specific styles. I understand Mapnik2 
already has some support for that (rendering North America different 
from the UK). I haven't looked at this closely but I guess it could 
probably be extended to much smaller units than countries - so one could 
have some sort of master shapefile that divides up the world in 
something like 5 different types of area and then use that to make 
certain decisions in your style sheets.

A third way, and that's coming back to the subject of this post, is 
trying to find out how dense a certain feature is. I could then write a 
style file that specifies a min/max scale denominator like we have now, 
but in addition I'd specify a &quot;max num features per megapixel&quot; or 
something. That would allow me to say that I want pubs drawn from zoom 
level 13 on, but only if there are less than 20 per megapixel or so. For 
some styles, a megapixel kind of rule might completely replace the scale 
denominator rule.

Of course this third way (and to a lesser degree the first and second) 
has many problems - first of all, simply counting features might not be 
enough (there might only be one feature but it might be very large and 
complex); second, how would one handle transition areas (large image 
with 100 pubs in the lower left corner); third, it would be horribly 
taxing on the PostGIS side (&quot;quick, count the number of pubs in this 1 
million square kilometer area&quot;), and fourth - it may turn out to be a 
cartographic nightmare - you pan across the map and see a pub in 
Thompson but none in London.

Maybe I'm just asking too much?

Bye
Frederik
