<PRE>Hello Dane,


Thanks for your detailed response. Some replies inline:

On Wed, Jan 12, 2011 at 7:06 AM, Dane Springmeyer &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-devel">blake at hailmail.net</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> A full debug compiled Mapnik binary on windows has never been offered, so great to hear you have done that - others may be quite interested in that.
</I>
I suggest I document the steps needed to make a build, rather than
provide debug binaries, since that's so compiler and
circumstance-specific. I 'documented' everything in a batch file, I'll
comment that some more and put it on the wiki. It'll never be as
straightforward as ./configure &amp;&amp; make but just knowing that it can be
done may already a major factor for others to give mapnik a shot...

&gt;&gt;<i> I made my own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project files for mapnik and the libraries that use a build system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that isn't directly supported by VS. (i.e., that nmake can't handle).
</I>&gt;<i> Which build system?
</I>
freetype uses autotools I think (don't remember by heart), icu
provides visual studio project files for windows, but only for VS10.
On unix it uses autotools also, I believe. My goal was to build with
only the tools provided by Visual Studio (vs9, in my case, but I think
it will work with at least 7 and 8, also).

&gt;&gt;<i> (snip me using static library)
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting. Are you sure you need it? Or is that just your preference? ICU in particular really seems like a pain unless shared.
</I>
True, I don't really *need* it, it's a deployment issue, and also a
bit of laziness on my part. Linking everything into one big binary
removes the hassle of the dllimport/export issues (especially with
third party libraries with their own build system) and syncing
compiler, cret and stl settings (_CRT_NO_WARNINGS,
_CRT_BIND_TO_LATEST_VERSION, _DISABLE_DEBUG_ITERATORS, etc.).

I may be able to get away with just providing the data part of icu in
a dll, although I haven't looked into it any more since I got it to
compile with the stub data file. It needs to be fixed though because
everything that has an ascii value of over 127 shows as a ? in the
result images.

&gt;<i> (snip static building)
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly a worthwhile consideration, thanks. You can attach a patch to trac.mapnik.org.
</I>
<A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/694">https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/694</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> They seem to make no effort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatsoever to support non-POSIX systems (specifically, Windows...).
</I>
It is quite clear from the tone in this that I was still quite annoyed
with the library when I wrote my mail ;)

&gt;<i> you mean the build system, or does the library function also suboptimal on windows?
</I>
Just the build system, I didn't get any further, nor have I ever used
it consciously. Considering that it's just a few functions it would be
hard to mess that up, though ;) So I think the actual functioning is
fine, I mean I have no reason to believe otherwise.

&gt;<i> Okay, again please attach this change to a patch at trac.mapnik.org and we will take a look to consider including.
</I>
<A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/691">https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/691</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> * rint() doesn't exist on VC. I added one in a private header, whose #include I #ifdef WIN32'd.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm, not sure what went wrong there, that was a known issue that should be handled here: <A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/browser/tags/release-0.7.1/include/mapnik/global.hpp#L163">https://trac.mapnik.org/browser/tags/release-0.7.1/include/mapnik/global.hpp#L163</A>
</I>
Oh I see, I hadn't found that one. Thing is that _WINDOWS isn't
defined by default, it needs to be set in the build tools, which
hadn't. _WIN32 is guaranteed to exist, with some caveats - patch and
notes at <A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/693">https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/693</A> .

&gt;&gt;<i> * I had to introduce some braces around calls to min/max (both in std:: and numeric_limits).
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, also please supply this as a patch on trac.mapnik.org.
</I>
<A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/692">https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/692</A> - note that I only yesterday
realized that this is only an issue when &lt;windows.h&gt; is included, so
when libldtl is used, this doesn't happen (I think, as long as
&lt;windows.h&gt; isn't included for something else. So the two are related.

&gt;<i> In mapnik trunk we've upgraded our usage of ptree so that it is compatible with the syntax in the actual released ptree versions, and so trunk no longer needs this copy (and I just removed it: <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/2515">http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/2515</A>).
</I>
Oh I see, no worries then.

&gt;&gt;<i> so that I can maybe find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out if I can leave out parts of icu all together.
</I>&gt;<i> That would be not be impossible, but difficult.
</I>
Yes I think the long-term solution is to just include it in full, as
the data turns out to be necessary in many more cases than I
originally suspected. I'll have to investigate the icu build system
and configuration options further when/if this becomes relevant (to
me).

&gt;&gt;<i> - how much of all code paths in mapnik does rundemo.cpp exercise?
</I>&gt;<i> Quite a bit, perhaps 70-80 % of C++ api. It mainly misses datasources other than shapefiles.
</I>
Ok that's nice, then I have some reasonable level of confidence in
there not being many platform/build issues in my tree.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a more comprehensive (c++) test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suite somewhere?
</I>&gt;<i> No. Because the Python bindings expose the vast majority of functionality (as they are abstract C++ classes) we mainly test via python, but certainly C++ tests are very much needed to. We have a few started in trunk/tests/cpp_tests but we need many more.
</I>
Ok thanks, I hadn't looked at trunk much yet. If the C++ is exercised
through the Python then that's OK too, I'd say. Once I become more
familiar with the code I'll have a feeling for myself what features
are used in rundemo.cpp, I was asking because I don't know the mapnik
API yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> should I forget about the current stable and use mapnik2?
</I>&gt;<i> Mapnik2 may need a little love to compile on windows. If you are up for helping (it certainly seems like you have the capacity!) with this I would encourage you to ride on trunk.
</I>
I'm going to get started with 0.7.1 at first, I'll keep an eye on the
blog to learn more about Mapnik2, what it's design goals are, what are
the shortcomings of v1 etc. If I know the v1 api to a reasonable
extent, I'll be in a better position when switching to v2 to have
something to compare to.


cheers,

roel
