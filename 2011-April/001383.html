I've known about the theorem since I was an early teen, although back 
then that was about the extent of it: knowing it exists, what it does, 
and what it means to certain maps.

You're right about the second part too: I don't see any practical use of 
adopting this for the main OSM maps.

I also wouldn't implement this in mapnik. It's not particularly suited 
to it, as in the most used scenario, mapnik hasn't even got full 
knowledge of the entire dataset, but just the bbox it has to render. If 
I would have to make a political map in this style, I would preprocess 
the areas and have a helper table with an area&lt;-&gt;colour mapping.
