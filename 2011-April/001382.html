<PRE>I suspect the reason is stated in the second paragraph of the
Wikipedia entry on the four color theorem: &quot;Despite the motivation
from coloring political maps of countries, the theorem is not of
particular interest to mapmakers.&quot;

Furthermore, there aren't many facilities (yet, hopefully there will
be more in the future ; although I'm not sure if it should be part of
'mapnik core' which IMO is or should be just the rendering engine) in
mapnik to automate the 'cartography' part of making maps. More
philosophically, the mapping/spatial data industry as a whole (in my
experience) has only just grown out of the phase where hand-drawing
maps are replaced by GIS systems; GIS are largely &quot;map-specific
drawing tools&quot;, rather than &quot;automated map making devices&quot;. We will
move in that direction eventually, of course; I like to compare this
evolution to &quot;hand-drawing building plans&quot; -&gt; &quot;AutoCAD&quot; -&gt; &quot;BIM/Revit&quot;
(for those unfamiliar with building design, AutoCAD lets you draw
lines and everything you need to 'emulate' a hand-drawn plan; it's
just computerization of the pen and paper. BIM (Building Information
Modeling) makes a complete 3D computer model of a building (not just
the geometry, like Sketchup does; but including the piping, materials
used, energy properties, environment etc), and the building plans are
just one product that can be derived from such a model.

That said, it's not particularly hard to write an implementation for
coloring maps like you ask for practical purposes; meaning, most maps
can be brute-forced if one wants to color it with just 4 colors. Maybe
the analysis to check if the map needs 4 or can suffice with 3 colors
would be a bit harder; although I guess the 'graph based proof' of the
four color theorem could be adapted for it. It's just that this
problem is largely theoretical, of interest only to mathematicians and
CS people, and not to cartographers. My experience confirms the
Wikipedia article - most cartographers I speak to have never heard of
the theorem and fail to see any practical use for it. Remember,
cartography is not just programming rules; it's part science, part
art.

cheers,

roel
