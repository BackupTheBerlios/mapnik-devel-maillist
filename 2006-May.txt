Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Handling of null values in numeric .dbf columns
Message-ID: <41082.10.238.10.70.1147503270.webmail@10.238.10.70>

When mapnik parses dbf files, it looks like the string version of all
numeric columns is passed directly to mapnik::fromString(), by
dbf_file::add_attribute() (plugins/input/shape/dbffile.cpp).  This can
cause a problem when the numeric column contains a null value (which is
valid, as far as shapefiles are concerned).  in this case,
mapnik::fromString() throws a BadConversion, which aborts things.

It seems like the length of the string should be checked, to make sure
there's some data there to pass along to fromString to begin with.  Also,
if the column does contain data, but it is truly malformed, maybe it
should be treated as though it were null, with some sort of warning?  I
suppose this is a judgement call.

Anyways, a simple check of the string length seems to fix the problem with
the null value:

Hi John,
This sounds reasonable and I'll integrate your patch.
Thanks!

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] New Release 0.3.0
Message-ID: <44722241.1080006@users.berlios.de>

Dear List,

I'm pleased to announce a new release of Mapnik - 0.3.0. It's been a 
long time but we have lots of new features, bug fixes, improvements.

Here are the major features:

1. License changed from GPL to LGPL
2. Python-based WMS server (WMS 1.1.1 and 1.3.0)
3. New Renderer interface
4. New Feature model
5. Font engine and text symbolization
6. Python and C++ demos
7. win32 support - yes, mapnik can be compiled (tested with vc-8_0) and 
happily runs
on windows now. (In the future win32 binaries and/or build instructions 
will be provided)
8. x86_64 support

Cheers
Artem
