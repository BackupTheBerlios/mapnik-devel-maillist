<PRE>Mapnik developers,

I'm trying to build some maps with ShiledSymbolizer but I had no success with allow_overlap, label_spacing and minimun_distace properties.

After many tests, I found the problem. Some of my lines have &quot;U turns&quot;, ie, it returns close than itself, and, in this case, the properties minimun_distace and allow_overlap are not used and one Shield could overlap another.

The solution that I found is to update the detector after each shield was placed. I did this in the end of the method &quot;void placement_finder&lt;DetectorT&gt;::find_point_placement( ... )&quot; (placement_finder.cpp:434), where the char envelopes have been moved to placement envelopes queue.

Are there collateral effects? I search for occurences of this method and I guess that is only called by Shield Symbolizer renderer.
This is supposed to work this way or is a bug? If it's not a bug, that is a chance to create a new porperty (allow_overlap_itself) in the next release?

Thanks

Bruno Caponi
