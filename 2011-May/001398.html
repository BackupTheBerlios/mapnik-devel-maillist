<PRE>Hi all,


With the first week of GSoC already over, here's my first status
report. I'm planning to do one each Sunday evening, I'm curious myself
though how punctual I'm going to be on that point ;)

- The past week (well the past 4 or 5 weeks actually) I've spend on
the VS project file generator. It's shaping up now - I've started over
a couple of times and finally settled on the most simple design, the
one that I started out with the first time. Specs of project- and
solution files are done in simple yaml files, processed by the 'vs4os'
Python program and using the Jinja2 template library rendered into
their output formats. For now I focus on VS9, other versions could be
added at some point. The most basic functionality works and I can
build a couple of the simpler mapnik dependencies (zlib, jpeg,
libtiff). Although I still think that choosing Python is the right
choice in the given context, my relative lack of experience with it is
proving a rather painful stumbling block; for example, I spend the
whole day today on figuring out how unicode support works in Python in
general, in Visual Studio and in the template library I use; and how
to make them work together. Not fun but at least it works now :)

For the coming week I have planned:
- Clean my source tree / directory layout up and check everything into
a branch in svn. I haven't made one yet because I need to get my ssh
key to work and that's a royal pain with putty etc so I've been
putting it off; I'm also working in an old checkout of the 0.7 branch
I had laying around so I'm going to need to decide first how that
should work.
- Do some communications things: blog post (Dane, how do I log on to
the Mapnik 'news' section? Can I post to the blog myself somehow?),
finally upload the minutes from the Skype meeting.
- Get the other dependencies working - Cairo, and maybe if I'm feeling
masochistic ICU.

Some other things:
- About the buildbot, is there a machine somewhere that can serve for
this? To have a Windows buildbot I'd need a Windows machine - shall I
just start on a bunch of virtual machines and we'll sort it out later
or is there something in place for that already?
- I've been getting some mails / im's from people who are interested
in using Mapnik on Windows, and php_mapnik, and are starting to find
my wiki page on it. So that's encouraging :) I'm hoping to attract
more users with some introduction articles for various websites. So I
was wondering, does anyone have a simple but nice map that is rendered
with Mapnik, with a small and free data set, that I can use for
demonstration purposes? The examples on the Mapnik website are OK but
either complicated or very specialized, I'd like to find an example
that needs only a few layers and appeals to a wide audience.


cheers,

roel
