<PRE>Hi Rob,

Thanks, I'll see if I can dig up the old document I once wrote where I
investigated continuous maps in RGB vs HSL color spaces. Our main use
case at the time was also height maps, it had pretty pictures and all,
I hope I can find it :)

I was asking about the docs because I'm keeping track of things I'm
doing re: building mapnik, and I hope to collate things into one
bigger, more comprehensive manual/organized wiki at some point
(although GSoC is focused on coding so I can't spend too much time on
it in that context). Since I missed that from the wiki page I figured
I'd ask and have it documented in the mailing list archives before it
disappears from people's minds :)

cheers,

roel

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no, I have some questions (I've only been on mapnik-devel since early
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this year so I may have missed previous discussion on this, sorry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about that):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not a huge amount more. Dane and Nino and I came up with the specs in
</I>&gt;<i> October after the GSoC summit and Ben implemented them as a project for
</I>&gt;<i> Koordinates. The key goal was to get something that solved more use cases
</I>&gt;<i> than the old RasterColorizer, and that was easier for a user to get their
</I>&gt;<i> head around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Why are only GDAL plugins supported? Are there more such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependencies where rendering depends on the data source type, and if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so are they being kept track of, and is there a plan how to eliminate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quickest results? It's not particularly difficult to extend it to the other
</I>&gt;<i> raster plugins, and I'd like to see this happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Does color blending work in RGB space and RGB space only? If so, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linear mode (btw may I suggest calling this 'blending-mode' or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something more descriptive than 'mode') is (in my experience) not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going to be very useful I'm afraid. We've had quite bad experiences
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with making maps informative with RGB linear interpolation, to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point where we (at my company) changed the default to HSL and as far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as I remember have never used RGB again because all maps came out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better using HSL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any examples of RGB vs HSL? RGB is used for everything else in Mapnik...
</I>&gt;<i> adding support for HSL could be a good addition, and again I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be overly difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The documentation/wiki page talks about 'stops' and stop colors,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which I think in the end describes a multi-color gradient, right? I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it would be better to describe the functionality in those terms,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as I think it's more intuitive. Also it would match better with other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> places in mapnik where gradients are used; there could be one central
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place where how gradients work in Mapnik is described in abstract form
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and only additions that are specific for some use cases would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be described separately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The docs will have to move into the Mapnik wiki - github was Ben's scratch
</I>&gt;<i> space. Happy for contributions/suggestions :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - What does the 'epsilon' parameter do? It says it's used for fuzzing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the color, but how does that work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have specific values you want to render (eg. 12=red), but your
</I>&gt;<i> dataset uses floating-point for storage it gets messy. I'll need to dig out
</I>&gt;<i> where the requirement came from, but there was a real and relatively common
</I>&gt;<i> use case for it.
