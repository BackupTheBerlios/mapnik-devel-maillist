<PRE>Hi all,

I've spend the last weeks on thinking about how to best accommodate developers
who want to use Mapnik in their own applications using Visual C++. This seems
like a narrow goal, but solving that problem will also take care of more general
issues with building Mapnik on Windows, getting automated builds etc.

Initially I started out with the most basic system, which is to choose one
version of Visual Studio to support, manually building the project- and
solution files (the components in Visual Studio that make up the build system)
and upgrading as the maintainer of that part of Mapnik upgrades. This is the
initial approach I took when building Mapnik for php_mapnik. It's clear that
this is not a sustainable solution, as it relies heavily on somebody actively
maintaining these files and is limited since people use a wide range of version
of Visual Studio in production (project files can be upgraded, so technically
one could support the lowest version and let users upgrade themselves; in
practice this doesn't always work because of details I won't bore you with).

The second approach I investigated was to use the Scons support for generating
Visual Studio project files. Scons has build targets with which one can make
these files. Since Mapnik already uses Scons, I was quite excited to find out
about this and I have been experimenting with it. It's easy to use, but I am
not convinced any more that going this way is the best solution for Mapnik.
First, only a subset of functionality is supported in Scons-generated VS files.
Secondly, there are some quirky things in the generated files that are there
because the VS files are supposed to be used in a Scons-based build
environment. My goal is only to use Scons to build an independent environment
(to stay with the customary way of working on Windows - otherwise we might as
well say that people should use Scons on Windows and be done with it). Thirdly,
adapting the Visual Studio parts of Scons isn't all that easy because it's all
quite integrated with how the rest of Scons works (which is normal when you
look at their goals, but like I mentioned they are not in line with what I
think the role of Visual Studio project files for Mapnik should be).

And then there is another issue, which is that if we make project files for
Mapnik dependencies that are only going to be used by Mapnik, the maintenance
burden is going to be much higher than it would be if we could share the
responsibility with other users of those libraries on Windows (I'm talking
zlib, libpng, Cairo, ...) I have made Windows builds of various project over
the last year or two, and although I now have everything set up on my machine,
I feel that many people have to reinvent the wheel and many give up halfway
through.

So, all these things combined lead me to explore another avenue, which is to
write a tool that will make, based on a simple description of what files should
be included in a project file or solution and some configuration options,
Visual Studio project files for a variety of Visual Studio versions. Such a tool
would be part of the release/build script which would create project files each
time new source files are added to the project. Ideally, it would integrate with
the 'native' build tool like Scons so that it could read the list of files from
the Scons or make or whatever build files; that way nobody would even have to be
aware that there are Visual Studio project files being generated for
the project.

Now there is more to building the mentioned libraries on Windows than
just making
the Visual Studio project. Some need to be configured by editing a header (like
for which core compression implementation to use, assembly or C, for
zlib); others
rely on headers generated by the autotools, etc. For Windows, this is quite
straightforward; it's always known which features are available
(sizeof() various
types etc). The tool would have to be able to patch a fresh download of the
library though so that it will compile, instead of having to rely on people
reading long steps of what to edit where etc. (like my current build
instructions on the Wiki are).

I have experimented with such a tool and the initial results are quite
promising; it's not hard to do and the level of abstraction to support common
open source libraries is manageable. I have written my prototypes in Python,
I'm not even sure why any more - I guess because I started with Scons but since
I don't know anything about Python this has been slowing down development a
bit. It's no big issue, and I think there are benefits to sticking with Python
- one, maybe it could share code with Scons one day, secondly Mapnik already
uses a lot of Python, and thirdly I don't really know what it would be written
in otherwise. I'm not looking forward to writing a simple tool like this in C++
and other scripting languages would only make the list of dependencies longer.

Ideally, such a tool would be a project separate from Mapnik, and Mapnik would
just be able to use it. At the moment though I'm using it within the Mapnik
source tree, it keeps the focus of the effort on Mapnik and I'd need separate
projects to build on Windows to make it work for them, too.

So, after all of this ;) , I'd like to solicit some feedback on this
direction. To make it more concrete, for Mapnik this would mean that there would
be a directory with some tools and config files to build Mapnik and its
dependencies. Users would download the source from the original project
websites (this was another requirement I set) to a predefined location, the
script would prepare the libraries and generate the project files, and users are
good to go. With the same effort, the release script could make a zip file with
all the sources pre-prepared; the user wouldn't even have to run any scripts, so
he wouldn't need Python installed and can use Mapnik as-is, all automated.

For my planning, this would constitute a bit of a change from the original
plan. I think it's best I get all dependencies working in this way before
tackling building Mapnik 2. Not a big deal, and would still all be done before
Mapnik 2, but still.

What do you think? Thanks.


regards,

roel
