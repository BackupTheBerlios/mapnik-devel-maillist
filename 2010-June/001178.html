<PRE>Good evening, how are you?

I just wanted to inform you what I've been doing this week. I haven't
written code to submit a patch, rather I've been doing some experiments with
cairo_renderer trying to find the pieces of code that affect the size of
symbolizers. You can see the results of these experiments here:
<A HREF="http://redmine.openpapermaps.com/projects/mapnikgsoc/wiki/Attempts">http://redmine.openpapermaps.com/projects/mapnikgsoc/wiki/Attempts</A> as well
as the descriptions of the changes I made to the code to produce the images
shown there.

Before yesterday's afternoon, it seemed to me that the best place to apply
the scale factor was in cairo_context class, since it makes the calls
directly to Cairo's context. However, after the experiment I ran with the
text_symbolizer, in which I modified the size of the text inside
cairo_context::add_text, I realized that some of the adjustments made
previously in cairo_renderer_base::process(text_symbolizer) were lost,
specifically those related to collision detection.

The changes I've tried so far mimic in some sense those of the first patch
of ticket 343 and I've gotten similar results (the thick roads, for
instance). The thick roads result from the fact that I'm only changing the
width of the line, but not its length. As the length of lines is determined
by the position of the points that make up the path of the line, it seemed
difficult, at first glance, to change the position of these points based on
the scale factor to then shrink or stretch the length, which I assume would
be done using some technique as the one described here:
<A HREF="http://www.mathopenref.com/dilate.html.">http://www.mathopenref.com/dilate.html.</A>

Therefore, my last thought was that maybe the answer could lie in the use of
Cairo's operations, specifically the scale transformation, and so I've been
studying the API with some examples, as my knowledge of Cairo is quite
limited.

Any advice or feedback is welcome.

Thanks

Carlos L&#243;pez
