<PRE>Hello!

Here's my status report for my summer of code project (hit-areas).

I had some problems finding a good way to do the job which I'll explain in
detail later, first I'll explain the basic idea: The user creates one or
more metawriter (I didn't find a better name) objects, which handle
different output formats and assigns these objects to symbolizers. A
sample XML config could look like this:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE Map&gt;
&lt;Map bgcolor=&quot;white&quot; srs=&quot;+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84&quot;&gt;
     &lt;MetaWriter name=&quot;meta test&quot; type=&quot;json&quot; file=&quot;test.json&quot; /&gt;

     &lt;Layer name=&quot;Mapnik test&quot; srs=&quot;+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84&quot;&gt;
       &lt;StyleName&gt;My Style&lt;/StyleName&gt;
       &lt;Datasource&gt;
         &lt;Parameter name=&quot;type&quot;&gt;osm&lt;/Parameter&gt;
         &lt;Parameter name=&quot;file&quot;&gt;mapnik.osm&lt;/Parameter&gt;
       &lt;/Datasource&gt;
     &lt;/Layer&gt;

     &lt;Style name=&quot;My Style&quot;&gt;
       &lt;Rule&gt;
         &lt;PointSymbolizer meta-writer=&quot;meta1&quot; meta-output=&quot;name: [name]&quot;/&gt;
       &lt;/Rule&gt;
     &lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/Map&gt;

However this lead to one big problem. The name/object pairs are stored in
the Map object and I had to resolve names to object references. This can't
be done at the time an symbolizer is parsed, as I wanted to maintain a
similar behaviour as styles (a style can be used in a layer before it is
declared). So had to find another place where to look up the name -&gt;
object mapping. There were different places which I tried, but they didn't
work out well:

1. Doing it in the renderer's process() function. This seems like an
obvious place to do it, but there were two problems: The map object is not
available in agg_renderer::process() and these functions are called so
many times it would proably significantly slow down the rendering process
to look up the mapping every time.

2. feature_style_processor::apply_to_layer() there I tried to do an extra
pass over all rules before rendering and resolving the names. I already
had the code ready to do this, however it failed because everything is
marked &quot;const&quot; there, so symbolizers couldn't store a reference to the
metawriter. Changing this seems to require a lot of changes which I
considered bad.

3. Current solution: Add a new call to the map object which resolves the
names. This function is automatically called after loading an XML config,
but has to be called manually when constructing the object with C++ or
Python code.


I was also asked to describe my impression of the code and the problems I
had with it.
One big problem was that about everything is undocumented and no document
exists giving a overview.

The most important problem was template usage. In Mapnik everything is a
template and this makes it hard to get an overview about what is
happening. If a plain type is used I can check look at the source file of
this type to understand what it does. But with templates I have to find a
place where the template parameters are specified first and then look them
up. And often the template parameters are a typedef for yet another
template type and I spend a lot of time researching all the parameters.

I have the impression that templates are often used instead of
inheritance. So one doesn't know which functions have to be supported by a
ceratain template parameter (also no documentation). One can either read
the code or just try it. Both is very timeconsuming. With inheritance one
could look at the base class and know what is done. It could also avoid
packing all symbolizers together in a boost::variant if they all had a
common base class with virtual functions.

Compiler errors with templates are very hard to understand. When just one
or two templates are used it's ok, but with 10 or more is get's
unreadable. The longest error message I got was about 400kB of text. The
compiler also has a hard time tracking all these templates and used about
1.5gb of RAM for a single file and a complete rebuild takes about
20minutes. And because a lot of functionallity is in header files often a
single change triggers a full rebuild.

These problems caused some delay for me, but I hope to be able to finally
provide working code this weekend.


Regards,

Hermann
