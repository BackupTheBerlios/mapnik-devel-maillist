<PRE>Thank you for your reply.

We use this algorithm:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid#Centroid_of_polygon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid#Centroid_of_polygon</A> .
We get the actual coordinates through the OSM XAPI, we request the way's
tags and the nodes forming the way.

I didn't reply sooner, because I wanted to test the new algorithm and OSM
had some problems for a few days. It works perfectly. For now it is a good
enough solution, thank you for the help again.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am contacting you regarding the calculation of centers of areas in OSM.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello Csongor,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I am aware of your application. I've yet to try it because it requires
</I>&gt;<i> 4.0 I'm resisting upgrading to the 4.0 iOS as I have heard it is quite
</I>&gt;<i> unstable of older iphones, but someday...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our product, OpenMaps (currently available on the iPhone and the iPod
</I>&gt;<i> touch), is the only one which lets you tap on POIs on the map. We use the
</I>&gt;<i> default OSM map as the default map type in our app, but the user can change
</I>&gt;<i> to OpenCycleMap and OpenPisteMap as well; also the user can add custom map
</I>&gt;<i> types (e.g. OSM Osmarender). We need to know the exact location of the
</I>&gt;<i> symbol inside an area (currently we use an algorithm which doesn't always
</I>&gt;<i> match the rendered symbol's location).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What algorithm do you use? Can you post an example?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How are you getting the actual coordinates of the area in the first place?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The best solution (from our perspective) would be to request the
</I>&gt;<i> calculated center from OSM, but I'm not sure that it's possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like a good route - to ask the same server which rendered the
</I>&gt;<i> tiles to tell you where the exact features are that were rendered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise we will implement the algorithm. If I'm not mistaken slightly
</I>&gt;<i> different algorithms are implemented in different renderers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also presume so. And each different stylesheet used for a given
</I>&gt;<i> renderer is potentially going to show different POI's with different symbols
</I>&gt;<i> of potentially different sizes - all of which impact which ones are placed
</I>&gt;<i> and where.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We are interested in the Mapnik version for now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, as I allude to above I don't think this issue is as simple as the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm, but certainly click-ability of features is important and the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm will make a difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Point me in the right direction, please; where can I find a description
</I>&gt;<i> of the algorithm and which source files contain the implementation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mapnik uses a centroid calculation that can be viewed here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/browser/trunk/include/mapnik/geometry.hpp#L218">http://trac.mapnik.org/browser/trunk/include/mapnik/geometry.hpp#L218</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We don't plan to maintain our own tile server in the near future. Also, I
</I>&gt;<i> learned that there was some discussion about making the centering more
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent, and it is possible that at some point the icon will be moved a
</I>&gt;<i> bit additionally to find free space;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, this is certainly a possibility longer term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hence we would like to have a general solution in the long term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the general or long term solution is to ask the server the for the
</I>&gt;<i> exact x,y or bbox of rendered POIs. Hermann Kraus is the Mapnik developer
</I>&gt;<i> that has given this quite a bit of thought, and in Mapnik trunk there is
</I>&gt;<i> support he has added for outputting GeoJSON from Mapnik that will provide
</I>&gt;<i> this information to be served along with tiles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
