&gt;<i> c) I've mentioned a few times before (on IRC, as recently as the code

</I>&gt;<i> whether they could be placed, and that there could be an 'else'  
</I>&gt;<i> construction to call other symbolizers upon that. This would also enable  
</I>&gt;<i> your AlternatePlacement proposal.
</I>
I've thought about this, too. However I think it is not the best solution.  
While it is flexible there are the following problems:
- configuration files become large and complicated
- it doesn't provide significant improvement over adding placement  
functionality to symbolizers
- it requires a lot of code changes
- it doesn't help with PointSymbolizer, etc. There you would have to  
define hundreds of rules just to allow moving a point some pixels in each  
direction.

It could be added, but it needs a lot of work which I think is better  
invested in making the most common use cases easy.

&gt;<i> It's not only the TextSymbolizer that could do with alternate  
</I>&gt;<i> placements. Point/ShieldSymbolizer could likewise benefit, as would the  
</I>&gt;<i> new MarkerSymbolizer.
</I>
Next problem: How should this work with MarkersSymbolizer? Does it return  
&quot;true&quot; when all markers were drawn, when 50% were drawn, or when at least  
one was drawn. It's not that easy to get the symbolizer return value you  
would like.
