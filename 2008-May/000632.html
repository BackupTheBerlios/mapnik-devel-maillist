Ah, you have an process &quot;idle in transaction&quot; which means it's not a
deadlock since that transaction could commit. A deadlock implies there
is no way out, which there is in this case.

&gt;<i> Yes, because I need repeatable reads and to avoid phantom reads.
</I>
Ok, though it's not clear to me why you need serialisation on top of
the explicit locking you're doing but I suppose you have a reason.

&gt;&gt;<i> Right. What I'm not sure about is whether mapnik can even work with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only one connection, given you can only do one query at a time through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one connection, so if mapnik wants to do multiple it's got a problem

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Huh. I actually have threading turned off and currently don't miss it,
</I>&gt;<i> though that could change.
</I>
It has nothing to do with threading, you might want to do multiple
queries at once in one thread.

Something odd though, on my installation I have quite a few layers and
yet it opens only one connection to the database, which makes me
curious as to why it's opening multiple for you. Perhaps you are
connecting to different database with different usernames?

&gt;<i> Yeah, me too. It works fine. It just seems inelegant to have multiple,
</I>&gt;<i> differing views of the database within a single thread of control.
</I>
You don't say how you are driving mapnik, but given Mapnik has a
connection manager, wouldn't it be easier to allocate your connections
via that? Or alter the connection manager to do what you want.

I'm afraid that's the best I can do given the limited information you
have provided. What you want is possible, but not standard...

Have a nice day,
