Hi Martin,

Thanks for the reply.

Here is the desired sequence of events and what I think is going on.

1. New transaction; set isolation level serializable.

2. Lock table &quot;foo&quot; (to prevent multiple running copies of the script).

3. A variety of queries, all read-only except updates to table &quot;bar&quot;. 
These have to be isolation level &quot;serializable&quot; to ensure consistency in 
the face of other processes updating the database.

4. Generate a bunch of tiles using mapnik, from &quot;bar&quot; and other tables.

5. Commit (releasing lock on &quot;foo&quot;).

I think the deadlock happens because Mapnik opens three separate 
connections (there are three datasources) to do Step 4. Because my 
transaction is isolation serializable, these connections wait until the 
changes to bar are committed; but that happens in Step 5.

The apparent deadlock happens even if I omit the lock on &quot;foo&quot;.

Note that even if there wasn't deadlock, this sequence is bad because 
the updates to &quot;bar&quot; will not be included in the mapnik tiles (they 
would be if mapnik used my connection).

Here is my workaround (5 DB connections when one is needed):

1. New connection A; new transaction; set isolation level serializable.

2. New connection B; lock &quot;foo&quot;.

3. Connection A: the queries.

4. Connection A: commit.

5. Generate mapnik tiles (using connections C, D, E).

6. Connection B: commit (releasing lock).

Thanks,

Reid

p.s. No need to CC me; I read the list.
