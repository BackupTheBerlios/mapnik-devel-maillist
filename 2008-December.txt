Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Any chance for a new win32 build???
Message-ID: <20081211102954.on8ztki064gkckck@www.support101.com>



   Artem (et al.),

   Some time ago you worked with my partner, Joe Kemp, to do some  
"one-off" win32 builds to fix some problems we had on our current  
project.

   Things have been going great but some new issues have come up  
(mainly involving labeling using NAVStreets data at "zoomed-out" view  
levels).? One in particular that I know there is a post-5.1 fix for is  
the ShieldSymbolizer hanging when usings points.

   Any chance a "5.2" win32 build would be possible?? If not, is  
another "one-off" possible?

   Thanks so much...love Mapnik!,

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] [PATCH] composition methods for point symbols
Message-ID: <da9d28170812251743k74c617f4s5330d72f7589041d@mail.gmail.com>

The attached patch allows symbols images to be merged using a variety
of methods (hue, sat, lum, colourize, and combinations) it adds the
following stylesheet option:

composition_method="colorize"

defaults to "copy".

If anyone can think of a better name for this functionality let me
know - I couldn't think of a good one!

Also adds generic hsl2rgb and rgs2hsl used for the above functionality.

Cheers,
