&gt;<i> Good evening and thanks again for you continuous help.

</I>
You're welcome, thanks for the great framing questions below.

&gt;<i> I was wondering if you could tell me something about the development  
</I>&gt;<i> process that the community follows. Maybe there is a philosophy that  
</I>&gt;<i> people here like most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well put!

&gt;<i> Some of the topics that might help me more are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Documentation: I was reading this page in the wiki <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTodo">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTodo</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> , and noticed that the community is interested in using DOXYGEN for  
</I>&gt;<i> documenting the code.
</I>Personally my development focus so far has been on python api docs,  
but we certainly need C++ docs. DOXYGEN is well known. Others may have  
ideas?
&gt;<i> Unit testing: Is there a C++ framework that the community prefer?  
</I>&gt;<i> I've used CxxTest, it is a framework similar to JUnit and doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> require much effort to install and use. However, it would be fun to  
</I>&gt;<i> learn some other.
</I>
Artem and I have discussed this. I think his idea was using Boost.Test  
or other methods of writing C++ using boost.
&gt;<i> Source Control: Here I wanted to ask how will the 'Better Print  
</I>&gt;<i> Support' project be managed. As a branch perhaps? Furthermore, will  
</I>&gt;<i> it be managed in the same repository as the Mapnik project?
</I>Artem as your lead mentor will decide on this. I am aware he is  
currently using git to manage his commits to mapnik-svn, so if you are  
interested in git, he could perhaps advise you on this approach.
&gt;<i> Integration and releases: How often do you expect a development  
</I>&gt;<i> cycle to last? I've been advised that a good idea might be to  
</I>&gt;<i> develop small pieces of functionality, integrate them with the rest  
</I>&gt;<i> of the code and present them to the community and mentor to receive  
</I>&gt;<i> feedback and then make the necessary changes.
</I>
I think for the first pieces (getting scaling working where feasible),  
this approach sounds great.
&gt;<i> Design: I am working on a UML diagram in which I'm trying to depict  
</I>&gt;<i> a general map of the code I've been reading (the renderers mainly).  
</I>&gt;<i> However, I wanted to ask you if I can be given a copy of design  
</I>&gt;<i> documents or diagrams you have produced for Mapnik over these years.  
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I'm doing this is to find the appropriate locations where  
</I>&gt;<i> the components or objects I will develop should be placed or  
</I>&gt;<i> interact in.
</I>
Good question. I've personally not developed any diagrams (despite  
being a visual thinker!), but would love to hear how others have  
approached this. Your question could be a good starting point for  
discussion.

&gt;<i> Communication: Will there be a preferred communication channel for  
</I>&gt;<i> discussing ideas (IRC, mailing list, direct e-mail, voice/video  
</I>&gt;<i> chat)? Furthermore, I think it is mandatory to send reports to track  
</I>&gt;<i> the progress of the project. Is there a special format you expect?  
</I>&gt;<i> periodicity (weekly, daily)?
</I>
Weekly reports are desired. I think a combination of the blog you have  
started plus the mapnik-devel mailing list should work well for now.  
We will let you know about format details/need for voice/video chat in  
the coming weeks.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't ask about the code style, because I've been getting familiar  
</I>&gt;<i> with it. There are also some coding standards I found here: <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTopics">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTopics</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> . However, if there is any resource you think I should read, please  
</I>&gt;<i> let me know.
</I>
That reminds me, we really need to fix the tabs/spaces issue in trunk  
asap :).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
