I have now modified the feature_style_processor.hpp (against 0.7.1) to 
first try the current method (backward project layer extent into map 
projection), but if that doesn't work, then forward project the map 
extent into the layer projection, to determine the bounding box 
intersection. Works like a charm for my particular itch, and as far as I 
can see doesn't break anything either.

Possible drawback is a little less than optimal performance for those 
cases that didn't work at all before - because the backward projection 
is always tried first even if the system could theoretically (somehow) 
find out that it doesn't make sense trying it.

Apologies for not sticking my patch to the correct ticket in trac, but 
none of the open ones on the BoundsClipping page actually seemed to 
match (but I could swear there was a ticket about this, a while ago). 
Also, I saw that my patch will not easily apply to 0.8 because a new 
custom max_extent mechanism has been added; someone will have to adapt 
my patch to 0.8 as I am currently unable to compile 0.8 and would rather 
not submit untested stuff.

Patch (for current 0.7.1 SVN) attached.

Bye
Frederik
