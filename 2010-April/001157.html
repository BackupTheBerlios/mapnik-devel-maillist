<PRE>Good evening and thanks again for you continuous help.

I was wondering if you could tell me something about the development process
that the community follows. Maybe there is a philosophy that people here
like most.

Some of the topics that might help me more are:


   - Documentation: I was reading this page in the wiki
   <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTodo,">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTodo,</A> and noticed that the community
   is interested in using DOXYGEN for documenting the code.


   - Unit testing: Is there a C++ framework that the community prefer? I've
   used CxxTest, it is a framework similar to JUnit and doesn't require much
   effort to install and use. However, it would be fun to learn some other.


   - Source Control: Here I wanted to ask how will the 'Better Print
   Support' project be managed. As a branch perhaps? Furthermore, will it be
   managed in the same repository as the Mapnik project?


   - Integration and releases: How often do you expect a development cycle
   to last? I've been advised that a good idea might be to develop small pieces
   of functionality, integrate them with the rest of the code and present them
   to the community and mentor to receive feedback and then make the necessary
   changes.


   - Design: I am working on a UML diagram in which I'm trying to depict a
   general map of the code I've been reading (the renderers mainly). However, I
   wanted to ask you if I can be given a copy of design documents or diagrams
   you have produced for Mapnik over these years. The reason I'm doing this is
   to find the appropriate locations where the components or objects I will
   develop should be placed or interact in.


   - Communication: Will there be a preferred communication channel for
   discussing ideas (IRC, mailing list, direct e-mail, voice/video chat)?
   Furthermore, I think it is mandatory to send reports to track the progress
   of the project. Is there a special format you expect? periodicity (weekly,
   daily)?


I don't ask about the code style, because I've been getting familiar with
it. There are also some coding standards I found here:
<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTopics.">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/DeveloperTopics.</A> However, if there is any
resource you think I should read, please let me know.

Thanks,

Carlos L&#243;pez
