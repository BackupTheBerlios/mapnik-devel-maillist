<PRE>Hi all,

I've been working on some bits that others may be interested in and I just
got them out to GitHub.  AFAIK, these are the first non-trivial Java/Mapnik
integrations using the mapnik-jni bindings that I got out last week.

   - <A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/nanomaps-server">https://github.com/stellaeof/nanomaps-server</A>
   - <A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-distiller">https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-distiller</A>
   - <A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni">https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-jni</A>


It shouldn't be too hard to figure out where I was going with things, but to
say it explicitly, this all came out of some work I have been playing with
to do the following:

   - Get OSM maps to render reliably and quickly on tiny hardware
   - Produce tooling that lets me develop map styles against live
   (unoptimized) databases and then compress it all down for optimized drawing
   - Produce tooling that lets me arbitrarily and easily reproject OSM data
   for maps in other projections (I have a client that needs the maps to line
   up with imagery in a projection I had never even heard of before).
   - Produce tooling that lets me take a map file and all of its data, strip
   out unneeded data/layers, and systematically simplify the geometries based
   on the use case (smaller geometries = much smaller data and faster rendering
   if the detail is not needed)
   - Just generally make it easier to get custom maps stood up and deployed
   - Generally do all of the above without access to hundreds of gigabytes
   of ram, SSDs in the servers or other such stuff that I just don't have

There is nothing here that very careful and detailed work on map styles and
data couldn't realize, but what I want is to be able to take the stuff that
isn't optimized for rendering, hack a map together and then push a button
labeled &quot;Make it small and fast.&quot;  I think I have largely accomplished that
with the mapnik-distiller project.

Unfortunately, I rsync'd the wrong directory to my server, so its going to
be a couple of days before there is a live demo.  But if there was a demo,
all you would see would be some OSM maps, which I think you've all seen
before.  :)

Let me know if anyone is interested in any of this work or has ideas.

Thanks.
