<PRE>I have attached some changes that I thought would enhance mapnik.  I've 
generated the diff set against trunk version 1331 and are attached.  I 
did not attempt to modify the other interface or subsystems (python or 
cario) to support the new/changed parameters.  If you have any 
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
Dave

Change log:

1.  Modified Text Symbolizer

    a) corrected line fragment centering (for 2nd and subsequent lines, 
when line breaks occur).

    b) adjusted vertical alignment calculation so that:
        i)      middle -&gt; has the center of the text line(s) at the 
point origin
        ii)     bottom -&gt; has the text line(s) below the point origin
        iii)    top -&gt; has the text line(s) above the point origin

    c) added new text_symbolizer attribute: 'wrap_before', value range: 
true/false, default == false

       allows line breaks at first wrap_char before wrap_width as an 
alternative to the original
       which was to create the line break at the first wrap_char after 
wrap_width

    d) added new text_symbolizer attribute: 'horizontal_alignment', 
value range: left/middle/right, default == middle
        i)      left -&gt; has all text line(s) to left of the point origin
        ii)     middle -&gt; has all text line(s) centered on the the point 
origin
        iii)    right -&gt; has all text line(s) to the right of the point 
origin

        NOTE:   dx, dy position adjustments are applied after alignments 
and before Justify.

    e) added new text_symbolizer attribute: 'justify_alignment', value 
range: left/middle/right, default == middle
        i)      left -&gt; after alignments, has all text line(s) are left 
justified (left to right reading)
        ii)     middle -&gt; after alignments, has all text line(s) center 
justified
        iii)    right -&gt; after alignments, has all text line(s) right 
justified (right to left reading)

    f) added new text_symbolizer attribute:  'opacity', value range: 0.0 
thru 1.0; 1.0 == fully opaque

    g) modified positioning to compensate for both line_spacing and 
character_spacing, to ensure proper
       centering of the text envelope.  Also ensure that centering 
occurs correctly even if no wrapping
       occurs.  Line spacing is uniform and consistent and compensates 
for errors between text_size and
       the actual size (ci.height is inconsistent, depending on case and 
character); fixes issue with
       multi-line text where some lines have a slight gap and others are 
compressed together.


2.  Modified shield_symbolizer

    a) added the attributes:
        i)      allow_overlap
        ii)     vertical_alignment
        iii)    horizontal_alignment
        iv)     justify_alignment
        v)      wrap_width
        vi)     wrap_character
        vii)    wrap_before
        viii)   text_convert
        ix)     line_spacing
        x)      character_spacing
        xi)     opacity

    b)  added new shield_symbolizer attribute: 'unlock_image', value 
range: true/false, default == false
        i)  false == image and text placement behaviour same as before
        ii) true == image placement independant of text, image is always 
centered at geometry point, text placed per attributes,
                    dx/dy only affect text.

        Allows user to create point markers with text, but both the text 
and image rendering collision detection are done
        as a pair (they come and go together - solves problem if using 
point_symbolizer and text_symbolizers where one or the
        other are omitted due to overlaps, but not both)

    c)  extended choices for the attribute 'placement' to include 
vertex; effect is limited to the shield_symbolizer

        Allows an attempted placement at every vertex available, gives 
additional shield placement volume when using line geometry

    d)  ensured that the text placement was not updating the detector 
unless a shield image was actually placed.

    e)  added new shield_symbolizer attribute: 'no_text', value range: 
true/false, default = false

        When set true, the text for the feature is ignored ('space' 
subsituted) so that pure graphic symbols can be used
        and no text is rendered over top of them.
