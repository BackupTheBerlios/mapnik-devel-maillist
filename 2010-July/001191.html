<PRE>Hi Carlos,

I'm not sure what the best library approach is but I imagine it would be 
better to have the chosen library (AGG, Cairo, etc) handle image scaling 
internally rather than separately resizing the images. I defer to Artem 
and others for what the &quot;correct&quot; approach is for mapnik though.

For the scaling itself I can imagine it would be useful to specify a few 
different options:
 * don't scale images at all (because they would look bad scaled up)
 * provide a way to choose the &quot;best&quot; image for a given scale
 * scale up images using nearest neighbor (for pixel graphics)
 * scale up images using the best quality algorithm available

There are already CSS properties for the last two options in SVG, 
image-rendering: optimizeQuality and image-rendering: optimizeSpeed. 
Firefox will support an additional hint to force nearest neighbor 
scaling: <A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/css/image-rendering">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/css/image-rendering</A>

Choosing the &quot;best&quot; size is obviously hardest because it's subjective. 
When putting together the print proposal we also talked about precedents 
like multi-size images (e.g. icon formats), mipmaps and scale-9 or 
9-slice scaling:

 * A multi-size image format could be as simple as making icons at 
different sizes, e.g. 16x16, 32x32, etc. and having a heuristic for 
choosing the &quot;best&quot; one for a given scale factor. Icon sets for the web 
commonly provide many different sizes. Mac OS icons also work this way: 
<A HREF="http://tutorialdog.com/how-to-create-icons-for-mac-os-x/">http://tutorialdog.com/how-to-create-icons-for-mac-os-x/</A>

 * A mipmap image uses a single texture file to store multiple 
resolutions: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap</A> - again, the problem is 
choosing the &quot;best&quot; resolution to use given the author's intent in the 
unscaled stylesheet and a scaling factor.

 * 9 slice or scale 9 is most useful for things like highway shields 
where you have variable sized content that you want to wrap with a 
border or a shadow. You define a rectangle inside an image such that the 
corners do not scale, the top/bottom borders scale horizontally only and 
the left/right borders scale vertically only. 
<A HREF="http://www.mordy.com/pics/symbol_guides.jpg">http://www.mordy.com/pics/symbol_guides.jpg</A> and 
<A HREF="http://rwillustrator.blogspot.com/2007/04/understanding-9-slice-scaling.html">http://rwillustrator.blogspot.com/2007/04/understanding-9-slice-scaling.html</A> 
explain more. I have also seen a variation that defines two rectangles: 
<A HREF="http://www.bytearray.org/?p=1206">http://www.bytearray.org/?p=1206</A>

Hope these references are useful! We're looking forward to trying the 
new functionality soon.

Best,

Tom.

</I>&gt;<i> The mapnik_resolution branch

</I>&gt;<i> that lets the user adjust the size of these elements. As you may know, 
</I>&gt;<i> the problem that is addressed with the scale factor is that when a map

</I>&gt;<i> and fonts remains at a smaller scale. For example, if you have a 
</I>&gt;<i> stylesheet with widths and sizes that will look good in a 600x400

</I>&gt;<i> size (1200x800), because the lines will be thinner and the labels and 
</I>&gt;<i> icons will be smaller. To correct this problem, one can pass a scale 
</I>&gt;<i> factor of 2.0, that will double the size of lines and fonts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The interface exposed to the user is currently the same as in trunk, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is passing the scale factor to the render method in python.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I'm beginning work with scaling symbols or bitmap icons. Trunk

</I>&gt;<i> to ask for ideas on how this should be done. I've found two 
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives so far:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * Make use of the CImg library (<A HREF="http://cimg.sourceforge.net/">http://cimg.sourceforge.net/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>       which is a very lightweight code that doesn't require linking as
</I>&gt;<i>       it is all contained in one single header file, but that has some
</I>&gt;<i>       dependencies on system libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>     * Make use of the mechanism that agg provides. This might be a
</I>&gt;<i>       good option since it is already a core component of mapnik. I
</I>&gt;<i>       don't have much experience with the library, but the code sample
</I>&gt;<i>       in <A HREF="http://www.antigrain.com/demo/image_transforms.cpp.html">http://www.antigrain.com/demo/image_transforms.cpp.html</A> shows
</I>&gt;<i>       that it is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas are welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
