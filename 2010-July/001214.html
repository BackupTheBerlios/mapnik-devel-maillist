</I>&gt;<i> Confirm date and location - I think we have enough to go ahead with
</I>&gt;<i> this.  I say, &quot;It's on&quot;, and I bet when you see the list of attendees
</I>&gt;<i> you'll say, &quot;Wow.  It sure is!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> TODO (Everybody):  Put the Mapnik Code Sprint: Committers and
</I>&gt;<i> Cartographers on your calendar now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Done. I can likely do either weekend. If September 24 - 26, 2010 is the consensus best date then that be it.

&gt;<i> Confirm venue - I'd like for somebody London-local to suggest the
</I>&gt;<i> perfect venue.  Please help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
yes, please help :) (says the other north american)

&gt;<i> A cool meeting place with a great internet connection and proximity to
</I>&gt;<i> food and entertainment is best.  A connected or nearby hotel for our
</I>&gt;<i> travellers, comfy and affordable is important.  And a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> connection to London airports is preferred.  Frugality is important.
</I>
All sounds good.

&gt;<i> At this point, we, the attendees, are sharing the expenses.
</I>
Yes, and I'll be likely lean on cash coming off several weeks in Spain for FOSS4G, so frugality sounds good.

&gt;<i> TODO (London Expert): Suggest perfect venue
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Approach sponsors - I have a a few potential sponsors in mind.  You
</I>&gt;<i> should send me your ideas too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be wonderful if a handful of sponsors would step forward and
</I>&gt;<i> offer to absorb the cost of the venue and some refreshments during the
</I>&gt;<i> code sprint.  It would be super if they would also agree to defray
</I>&gt;<i> some of the travel expenses for those who could use the help.  It
</I>&gt;<i> would be over the moon amazing if they would express interest in a
</I>&gt;<i> series of code sprints with shared sponsorship.  I like the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> another code sprint in early 2011 as well.
</I>&gt;<i> TODO (Richard): contact potential sponsors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
well put!

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback
</I>&gt;<i> ========
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes please.  Replies to this list preferred, or directly to me.
</I>
Thanks for the awesome effort organizing.
