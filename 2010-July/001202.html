<PRE>Greetings Mapnik Devs,

On the heels of a great Mapnik Birds of a Feather last week at State
of the Map, Dane has suggested that we build on that momentum and have
a meeting that is bigger and even more productive.  Let's put on a
code sprint.


What?

A code sprint, or hack fest, is a period of software development
focused on a given list of goals. Committers and Cartographers is a
free and open three-day event for the improvement of the mapnik code
base.

The goals for Committers and Cartographers will be:

- Cartography Improvements - Discuss and defeat some tricky
cartography requests.  There may be others but those highlighted by
Steve Chilton in the SotM talk are a good start.
<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/steve8/what-id-like-to-do-with-mapnik-4756837">http://www.slideshare.net/steve8/what-id-like-to-do-with-mapnik-4756837</A>

- Maintainer Farming - Encourage community members to take a greater
part in maintaining the Mapnik code, perhaps by taking the lead on a
smaller portion of the code base.


Who?

If you are a current committer to Mapnik or an otherwise super cool
C++ coder intimately familiar with the project, you should be at
Committers and Cartographers.

If you are a super cool cartographer who hopes and dreams for a better
mapnik, you should be at Committers and Cartographers.

What if you are both a super cool cartographer and a whiz bang C++
developer?  Why aren't you here already?  We hope to get about a dozen
key Committers and Cartographers to attend this event.


When?

Three days in September.  Let's work this out, but let's plan on a
Saturday, Sunday and Monday as working days.


Where?

Well Toronto would be convenient for me, but this isn't about me.  How
about London, England?   It is well-connected by air to many of our
anticipated European and North American participants.


Please indicate your interest and availability so that we can get a
head count and a nominal date.

Best regards,
Richard
