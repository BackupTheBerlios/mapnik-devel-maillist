</I>
Now I've had some wonderful feedback on this, but you wouldn't guess
that from looking at the list.  Here is what I have so far.


Date
====

September 24 - 26, 2010 is the consensus best date.


Venue
=====

London-ish has been chosen as best location, with some other votes for
&quot;near home&quot; for some value of home.


Attendees
=========

I won't name names.  I'll leave it to you to confirm on the list if
you wish to do so.

Those considering attending, you should really do this.  The list of
those interested really delivers on our quest for both Committers and
Cartographers.  This is going to be THE meeting of the Mapnik Cool
Kids.  I'm very excited about the code that is going to come from this
code sprint.

So, with all of the high-powered, Mapnik Super Heroes that are planing
to attend, why should you come along?  Won't the cool kids just push
you into your locker and mock you?  No.  They won't.  The Mapnik
community doesn't play that game.

You should participate in the code sprint, because you can contribute,
too.  Your idea might be the one that breaks a logjam on a tough
rendering problem.  You might find a new passion for packaging, tests
or documentation that will help others in their adoption of Mapnik.
You might be the one who catches the typo and saves the day.  Or maybe
you just don't realize yet, how much you have to contribute to the
Mapnik community.

So you should come.
TODO (you!); add yourself to the attendee list.


Next Steps
==========

Confirm date and location - I think we have enough to go ahead with
this.  I say, &quot;It's on&quot;, and I bet when you see the list of attendees
you'll say, &quot;Wow.  It sure is!&quot;
TODO (Everybody):  Put the Mapnik Code Sprint: Committers and
Cartographers on your calendar now.

Confirm venue - I'd like for somebody London-local to suggest the
perfect venue.  Please help.

A cool meeting place with a great internet connection and proximity to
food and entertainment is best.  A connected or nearby hotel for our
travellers, comfy and affordable is important.  And a reasonable
connection to London airports is preferred.  Frugality is important.
At this point, we, the attendees, are sharing the expenses.
TODO (London Expert): Suggest perfect venue

Approach sponsors - I have a a few potential sponsors in mind.  You
should send me your ideas too.

It would be wonderful if a handful of sponsors would step forward and
offer to absorb the cost of the venue and some refreshments during the
code sprint.  It would be super if they would also agree to defray
some of the travel expenses for those who could use the help.  It
would be over the moon amazing if they would express interest in a
series of code sprints with shared sponsorship.  I like the idea of
another code sprint in early 2011 as well.
TODO (Richard): contact potential sponsors.


Feedback
========

Yes please.  Replies to this list preferred, or directly to me.


Best regards,
Richard
