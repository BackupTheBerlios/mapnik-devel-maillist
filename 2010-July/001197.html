<PRE>Hello everybody,

I just wanted to share a script that supports part of the work of this
project.

render_with_resolution.py is an experimental script with two purposes:

&#8226; To define a possible interface to the resolution functionality of the
mapnik_resolution branch.
&#8226; To find the proper operations to obtain a scale factor that adjusts the
size of lines and fonts given a resolution parameter.

The idea behind this script is to produce an image that will fit a certain
physical space. This physical space might be the size of the paper or PDF
document (or a region of it) on which the image of the map is to be printed.
Furthermore, a given PPI (pixels per inch) value is required to obtain a
certain quality on the image. In reality, the script accepts one PPI value
for the horizontal dimension and one for the vertical dimension.

Given the PPI values and the desired physical space (measured in inches or
millimeters), the script computes the size of the digital image in pixels
(its resolution) using the following formula:

    width of digital image = horizontal PPI x physical width of target space
    height of digital image = vertical PPI x physical height of target space

For example, if I want to print an image on a space of 13x8 inches at 300
PPI, I would obtain a digital image of 3900x2400 pixels.

Now, if I requested an image of this size, I would obtain a very large map
with very tiny labels and thin lines. This is the problem we are trying to
solve with the introduction of the scale factor. This scale factor will make
sure that the width of lines and size of fonts grow/shrinks proportionally
to the size of the image.

The script calculates the scale factor as the quotient of the required PPI
and a base PPI value. This base PPI value is calculated from another couple
of values that have to be supplied by the user: The pixel width and height
of the rendering device. The formula is as follows:

    base horizontal PPI = 1/pixel width
    base vertical PPI = 1/pixel height

So if the supplied pixel size was 0.28x0.28mm (the OGC standard pixel size),
we would have a base PPI value of approximately 90.1, both horizontally and
vertically (convert the size of pixels in millimeters to inches first).

As I said before, this base PPI value serves as a base from which to
calculate the scale factor. The scale factor would be calculated this way:

    horizontal scale factor = horizontal PPI / base horizontal PPI
    vertical scale factor = vertical PPI / vertical horizontal PPI

Right now, it doesn't make sense to have a scale factor for both dimensions.
So, using the previous values, the scale factor would be 300/90.1 = 3.329.

However, this scale factor is not large enough to make the lines and fonts
look good in the 3900x2400 pixels image. To account for this, a larger pixel
size would need to be supplied (to make the base PPI value smaller and hence
the quotient of the required PPI and the former larger).

I'm not completely sure if this is the correct way of calculating the scale
factor, since the base resolution is quite dependent on the value of the
supplied pixel size, which might be hard to get it right. Here's where I ask
for your opinions and comments.

I would also appreciate if someone could test the script. The steps you have
to follow are:

    1) Export the mapnik_resolution branch: svn export
<A HREF="http://svn.mapnik.org/branches/mapnik_resolution">http://svn.mapnik.org/branches/mapnik_resolution</A>
    2) Compile and install it.
    3) Go to tests/scale_factor_calculator. This is the directory where the
script lives. The script is called 'render_with_resolution'. Also, in this
directory you'll find a copy of nik2img.py and its required dependencies.
This is because the script calls it after calculating the image size and
scale factor to actually render the image.
    4) Generate an osm.xml stylesheet and upgrade it.
    5) Run the script like this:

python render_with_resolution.py styles/osm.xml images/image.png -b -0.02894
51.48472 0.0002 51.4976 --width 13.3 --height 8.3 --dimension-units in
--ppi-x 300 --ppi-y 300 --pixel-width 0.010466 --pixel-height 0.010466
--pixel-size-units in

Parameters:

    --width: Width of the physical space that the map will cover (in inches
or millimeters).
    --height: Height of the physical space that the map will cover (in
inches or millimeters).
    --dimension-units: Units in which the previous two values are given (in
or mm)
    --ppi-x: Pixels per inch in the horizontal dimension.
    --ppi-x: Pixels per inch in the vertical dimension.
    --pixel-width: Width of pixels in inches or millimeters.
    --pixel-height: Height of pixels in inches or millimeters.
    --pixel-size-units: Units in which the previous two values are given (in
or mm).

Thanks in advance
