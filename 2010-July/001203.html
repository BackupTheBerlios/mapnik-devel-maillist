<PRE>Recently I noticed the large number of:

#ifdef MAPNIK_THREADSAFE
    mutex::scoped_lock lock(mutex_);
#endif

wrapping the proj4 code in proj_transform.cpp and projections.cpp.

Proj4 has thread safety issues so this makes sense:

1) Projection initialization in not thread safe (when creating from epsg code)
2) Usage of prj_errno is not thread safe (error code pointer)
3) in rarer cases pj_transform is also not threadsafe (when transforming coordinates)

My thoughts were:

#1 As of proj 4.7 locking is done by proj4, so no need to duplicate locking in mapnik as far as I can tell

#2 is not a problem currently for mapnik because we don't attempt to do anything with errors (but we may in the future - <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/BoundsClipping">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/BoundsClipping</A>)

#3 - can't do much about this.

So, I set out to deal with #1 and noticed a few more things:

1) there is a lock that affects proj_transform, even if we exit early because we don't need to reproject (source == dest). What this means is that even when proj4 is not used, since we call proj_transform we're hitting a lock for every coordinate reprojected (<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/browser/trunk/src/proj_transform.cpp?rev=2062#L74">http://trac.mapnik.org/browser/trunk/src/proj_transform.cpp?rev=2062#L74</A>). Ouch.

2) There are additional locks around repeated calls to proj._is_latlong, and a bit of refactoring could set this property once and avoid several locks.

So, I set up a test environment that would hit mapnik with hundreds of current threads when rendering a small shapefile dataset (to make sure that database i/o would not get in the way of benchmarking).

With the changes in <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/2063">http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/2063</A> I'm seeing 10-15% speed increases.

So, I'm excited to report this performance improvement, and curious to see if anyone had questions or concerns.

My test environment is apache ab. I've heard its not as good as http_perf, so I'm looking into that tool. I've been testing against a lightweight C++ server using boost asio (<A HREF="http://github.com/springmeyer/paleoserver">http://github.com/springmeyer/paleoserver</A>), which I put together partially  to making running tests like this easier. On a RHEL machine with 4 cores I can get around 150-170 requests/sec. when calling ab with 50 concurrent requests and 1000 total requests.

Cheers,

Dane
