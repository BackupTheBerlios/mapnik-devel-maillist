</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;/Datasource&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   &lt;/Layer&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So how would I do it with the road layer?
</I>
Well, one way to do it _might_ be to turn it into muliple layers, one
with highway=motorway, another with highway=primary, another with
highway=secondary etc.

The downside of this is that if also effects the sequence that things
are rendered. For example, if you got things wrong, you might find your
primary road which is meant to go on a bridge over the motorway now gets
drawn underneath the motorway line.

This is exactly the problem that the 'order by z_order' tries to
address. The z_order field is calculated by osm2pgsql based on the
layer, tunnel, bridge tags (highway type has influence too).

&gt;<i> &gt; partitioning the data into more tables in the DB (done to an extent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the planet_osm_roads table). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I imported the data with a OSM tool. This would need to modify the tool
</I>
Yes it would

&gt;<i> &gt; Another feature which I've seen take excessive amounts of time is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'order by z_order' on some of the SQL select lines. This really takes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a significant amount of CPU when fetching many thousand entries from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the DB. Reducing the amount of data being fetched would obviously
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help here too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to work good. I improved the map rendering time from 4:5 to 3.4 seconds 
</I>&gt;<i> (complete germany). Not yet perfect, but a start.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the drawback of not using z_order. I assume it was used for some reason.
</I>
As mentioned above, this is used to help ensure the correct rendering
order for tunnels, layers, bridges etc. This is important for higher
zooms where these features are visible but you could argue that this
becomes less important at lower zooms.

I've hinted already that these sorts of optimisations do effect how the
output gets rendered so you will probably need to do experiments to get
a good feel for how the rule/style/layers interact when you make
changes.

As you mention, making more substantial change may require further
enhancements to osm2pgsql, the database tables or the Mapnik code.

Another optimisation which I think Artem played around with before was
simplifying the geometries in the tables. We do not need to preserve the
every single node along every road when rendering country-scale maps.
Again this would require more processing during the data import.

On the main tile server the time taken to render the high zoom tiles
(especially zoom 17 &amp; 18) is far higher than the low zoom tiles.
Optimising the rendering time for the 1024 tiles at zoom 5 tiles makes
very little difference compared to the time spent rendering the 44
million tiles that are rendered at zoom 17*. Obviously you've got
different priorities because you want the rendering to be fast at all
zooms.

* This is based on the number of tiles present on the tile server at
zoom 17 on 2008-06-27. For a spreadsheet with the tile stats see:
