</I>
The main difference is the intended range of zoom levels. 

Data to be shown at low zooms is in &quot;planet_osm_roads&quot;. and rendered by
&quot;roads&quot;. This renders up to a highest MaxScaleDenominator 25M [1] or
zoom 5.

The &quot;planet_osm_roads&quot; data rendered by minor-roads-fill has a highest
MaxScaleDenominator in minor-roads-fill of 1M [2] or zoom 10.

Arguably this is really a little too high. You would probably speed up
your rendering significantly if you change this scale to 500k. The way
that the zooms work, each change in zoom level is a factor of 4 in the
area and data covered. 

The biggest win occurs when you manage to reduce the highest
MaxScaleDenominator across all the rules in a style. Mapnik will then
completely exclude fetching any data for that style at the higher zooms
(to be more exact, it is probably the range of zooms for all styles of a
layer, but there is often a close match between the styles and layers). 

In the case of the roads, there are a couple of other rules which
specify 500k as well. If you wanted to gain much more performance then
these would all need to be reduced (say to 250k). This obviously changes
the zoom level that these features start appearing in the rendered
output. There is a mapping between zoom and scale in the
zoom-to-scale.txt file.
