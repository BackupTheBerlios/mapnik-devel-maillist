<PRE>Hello,

I use mapnik in an application with real time rendering. It works well,
but the performance is really bad in big zoom levels.

If the zoom level is around 1-5 km it's fast enough. But if e.g. a
complete city or country is rendered, then it's really slow. I created
a map XML that renders only a few information at those zoom levels. In
country zoom level I render only the capital cities and some freeways.
But it's still very slow.

So I assume the big problem isn't the drawing. The performance
bottleneck seems to be before that.

What is faster? Using libxml2 or not? Using cairo or not?

Currently I use PostGIS (OSM) as data source (Germany only). Is there a
faster data source?

What else could I do to improve map rendering performance?

Until now I didn't profile mapnik. Has one of you yet profiles mapnik
and identified the bottleneck?

Maybe it's needed to improve some algorithm in mapnik itself. For sure
this would need first to find the bottleneck.

I also had another idea the improve moving on the card in applications.
I thought about rendering a bigger map that my screen. Then I could
move around on the screen without rendering new maps by mapnik. But
this has a bad influence on getting a full new map (e.g. while zooming).

The basic idea behind this is to invest more into caching. Why would I
render the same data again and again? Is there a caching concept in
mapnik? Would you see such a concept in mapnik or on top of it?

Another idea: Is it possible to strip more useless data from the
database to get it smaller?

My test system is a 2Ghz system with 2 GB RAM. But I would like to get
it running smooth with 1GHz.

regards
Andreas
