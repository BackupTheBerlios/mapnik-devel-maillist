&gt;<i> &gt; You mean thats's possible in the XML file only?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So how would I do it with the road layer?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, one way to do it _might_ be to turn it into muliple layers, one
</I>&gt;<i> with highway=motorway, another with highway=primary, another with
</I>&gt;<i> highway=secondary etc.
</I>
Now I played some more around with roads in the XML file. What I still
not understand is the difference between layer &quot;minor-roads&quot; and
&quot;roads&quot;. One gets its data from &quot;planet_osm_line&quot; the other from
&quot;planet_osm_roads&quot;. Could you explain that?

&gt;<i> The downside of this is that if also effects the sequence that things
</I>&gt;<i> are rendered. For example, if you got things wrong, you might find
</I>&gt;<i> your primary road which is meant to go on a bridge over the motorway
</I>&gt;<i> now gets drawn underneath the motorway line.
</I>
Ok, I like to do it right. So for what should I pay attention.

&gt;<i> This is exactly the problem that the 'order by z_order' tries to
</I>&gt;<i> address. The z_order field is calculated by osm2pgsql based on the
</I>&gt;<i> layer, tunnel, bridge tags (highway type has influence too).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; partitioning the data into more tables in the DB (done to an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; extent with the planet_osm_roads table). 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I imported the data with a OSM tool. This would need to modify the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tool
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it would
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Another feature which I've seen take excessive amounts of time is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the 'order by z_order' on some of the SQL select lines. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; really takes a significant amount of CPU when fetching many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thousand entries from the DB. Reducing the amount of data being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; fetched would obviously help here too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Seems to work good. I improved the map rendering time from 4:5 to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.4 seconds (complete germany). Not yet perfect, but a start.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the drawback of not using z_order. I assume it was used for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some reason.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned above, this is used to help ensure the correct rendering
</I>&gt;<i> order for tunnels, layers, bridges etc. This is important for higher
</I>&gt;<i> zooms where these features are visible but you could argue that this
</I>&gt;<i> becomes less important at lower zooms.
</I>
Yes, at least I could try it.

&gt;<i> I've hinted already that these sorts of optimisations do effect how
</I>&gt;<i> the output gets rendered so you will probably need to do experiments
</I>&gt;<i> to get a good feel for how the rule/style/layers interact when you
</I>&gt;<i> make changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you mention, making more substantial change may require further
</I>&gt;<i> enhancements to osm2pgsql, the database tables or the Mapnik code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another optimisation which I think Artem played around with before was
</I>&gt;<i> simplifying the geometries in the tables. We do not need to preserve
</I>&gt;<i> the every single node along every road when rendering country-scale
</I>&gt;<i> maps. Again this would require more processing during the data import.
</I>
I'm interested to try any idea where I get input from this list. If
someone has also interests in improving mapnik performance I think we
should combine our work.

&gt;<i> On the main tile server the time taken to render the high zoom tiles
</I>&gt;<i> (especially zoom 17 &amp; 18) is far higher than the low zoom tiles.
</I>&gt;<i> Optimising the rendering time for the 1024 tiles at zoom 5 tiles
</I>&gt;<i> makes very little difference compared to the time spent
</I>&gt;<i> rendering the 44 million tiles that are rendered at zoom 17*.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously you've got different priorities because you want the
</I>&gt;<i> rendering to be fast at all zooms.
</I>
Yes, as I use it to render maps while viewing. I also thought about
using pre-rendered tiles for country level zoom.

Andreas
