Unfortunately I don't think I am able to offer the time to write 
documentation. I would, however, be happy to offer my Python script as 
an example.

#9, I believe. I also entered a few others.

</I>
Sure. I put it into trac #10.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm quite happy to start discussion about better building system for mapnik.
</I>&gt;<i> I have some experience with the following :
</I>&gt;<i> 1. autotools
</I>&gt;<i> 2. scons
</I>&gt;<i> 3. cmake
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Boost.Build.v2 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but it is not clear to me which one is the best fit. Mapnik was using autotool

</I>
I don't know a whole lot about programming to any of those build 
systems. I did use autotools some years ago and found it pretty 
straightforward, so I'm surprised that autotools required writing 
significant numbers of M4 macros, but I never used it for Python or C++ 
projects.

Given that, speaking as an end-user, these are the things that I found 
difficult about scons:

1. It's unfamiliar. ./configure, make, make install is pretty great IMO.

2. Difficult to install into non-standard locations.

3. It seems to redo all the library checks before each operation, even 
an invalidly-specified one; e.g. try &quot;python scons/scons.py build&quot; -- 
for me it chugs away detecting libraries for 7 seconds before telling me 
that &quot;build&quot; is an invalid operation.

Python modules seem to be moving increasingly to &quot;distutils&quot; 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.4/lib/module-distutils.html">http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.4/lib/module-distutils.html</A>&gt;, which I 
have not used except as an installer. I don't know how suitable this 
would be for people who just want to use the C++ interface.

Take care,

Reid
