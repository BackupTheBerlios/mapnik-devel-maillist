<PRE>Mapnik-dev,

Based on discussion in #mapnik IRC on freenode.net, we've decided that  
our next release target is 0.6.0, given the major enhancements to the  
codebase including ICU (Unicode) and Cairo support as well as distinct  
improvements to the Scons build system and the methods available in  
the python bindings.

Artem has been busy making commits and closing tickets towards this  
goal. Many recent patches have now landed in trunk, including those  
from Jon Burgess (numerous), Robert Coup (PostGIS Optimizations),  
Justin Bronn (Scons build), and Leslie Wu (Memory Datasource).

I have been organizing and sorting all Trac tickets for the 0.6.0  
milestone:
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/0-6-milestone-priorities">http://tinyurl.com/0-6-milestone-priorities</A>

Here's what you can do:

  - If you have any outstanding patches, please post them to Trac  
__now__.
  - If you have any opinions/thoughts on the existing tickets against  
the 0.6.0 milestone, please comment on them.
  - If you have yet to contribute to Mapnik, considering finding a  
ticket, noting in the comments you are going to work on it, and  
starting to work.

We've got 38 Active Tickets slated for the 0.6.0 milestone, and as we  
close or defer those remaining tickets in the following weeks I hope  
to set a formal release schedule.

Thanks!

Dane
