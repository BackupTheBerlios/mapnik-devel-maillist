Subject: [Mapnik-devel] mapnik win32 binaries
Message-ID: <ECC1FF39-ECCE-489E-9CE4-868BC8BBC7B6@mapnik.org>

Hello lists,

Yesterday, I built and packaged win32 binaries for Mapnik:
http://media.mapnik.org/mapnik_win32-bin_20070426.zip

All libraries including dependencies are built with VC++ Express on  
Vista.

There is no installer (yet) so you have to setup %PATH% etc yourself.  
In 'bin' directory (e.g c:\\mapnik\\bin ) there is a small demo  
application 'rundemo.exe' which produces two map images from demo  
data. You can run it like this:

rundemo.exe c:\mapnik\lib\mapnik\input

Everyone (with Windows box) is encouraged to give it a try and report  
any problems, gotchas ... If everything is OK then win32 binaries  
will be available as a part of Mapnik release, starting from 0.4.1.

Cheers,

Artem Pavlenko

Hello Artem,

I think I'm finally getting round to doing this.

Could you give me some pointers as to which variables represent label 
cache, it's a little hard to see from the source.

Looking at the code of agg_renderer.cpp it looks like:

template <typename T>   void agg_renderer<T>::process(text_symbolizer 
const& sym,                               Feature const& feature,         
                        proj_transform const& prj_trans) 


handles drawing features on text, though it's unclear what stops text 
being drawn if label cache fills up. Is it the find_placements () method?
Is there anything I can do in this method to force the label on the 
feature to always be drawn?

Thanks,
Nick

agg_renderer -> placement_finder -> label_collision_detector3 ->  
quad_tree
We need a 'clear' method in quad_tree, label_collision_detectorxxx,   
placement_finder  and an extra property in Layer object.
I''ll have a go implementing missing bits and I'll let you know.

Cheers,
Artem
