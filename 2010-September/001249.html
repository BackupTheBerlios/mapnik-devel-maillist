I think that ICU is probably actually part of the problem here, rather 
than the solution.

Unless things have changed recently I don't think ICU can actually help 
with some of the issues - specifically I am thinking about shaping 
issues here.

The fundamental problem is that for some languages you need to choose 
different glyphs for a codepoint depending on where that codepoint is in 
a word. That means that you have to process whole words when doing glyph 
selection rather than individual codepoints.

There is a hack in ICU to work around this issue for a few languages - 
arabic is one but there may be others. That works by replacing generic 
codepoints with ones which code for a specific (start/middle/end) 
version of the character. That hack is what mapnik currently uses to 
handle arabic text.

The problem is that ICU doesn't have that hack for other languages which 
need shaping, and it may well not even be possible as it requires that 
unicode contain specific codepoints for each version of the character.

Another problem with the character by character processing mapnik does 
is that line breaking is wrong for RTL languages as IIRC mapnik works by 
reversing the list of codepoints and then processing them as if it was 
an LTR language.

The solution is to use something like pango which can take a whole 
string of unicode codepoints and render the correct glyphs - pango has 
support for the necessary special cases in a wide range of languages. 
Pango can also tell you where should break lines.

Of course the problem is that mapnik likes to render character by 
character so it can render along a curve, and that does not fill well 
with wanting to render whole strings...
