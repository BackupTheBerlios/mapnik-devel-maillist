<PRE>Greetings Mapnik Devs,

It is time for you to mark your calendars and book your trips for the
first Mapnik Code Sprint: Committers and Cartographers.  We are three
weeks away from this event.  Book now!

When?

Friday 24 September 2010 - Sunday 26 September 2010

Where?

The Mapnik Code Sprint will be held in the tourist-popular South Bank
section of London England.  The nice folks at CloudMade have offered
to host us at their office so we'll have a friendly space, nearby pubs
and great Mappy Ambiance.

Where else?

Well here is a pleasant surprise!  The nice folks at Stamen Design
have decided that they have to be part of this event, and we're
thrilled to hear it, so they are hosting a remote Mapnik Code Sprint
at the same time[1] at their office in the Mission District of
beautiful San Francisco.

Who?

We have a superstar line up of Mapnik Developers and cartographers
attending this event.  In London, we'll have Mapnik founder, Artem
Pavlenko, Mapnik project administrator, Dane Springmeyer and Steve
Chilton, Chair of the Society of Cartographers, plus a cast of
thousands[2] of the key developers and cartographers involved in
Mapnik and OpenStreetMap.  In San Francisco we'll have Michal
Migurski, of Walking-papers.org and Stamen Design fame, leading a huge
robot army[3] of developers

If you are a current committer to Mapnik or an otherwise super cool
C++ coder intimately familiar with the project, you should be at
Committers and Cartographers. If you are a super cool cartographer who
hopes and dreams for a better Mapnik, you should be at Committers and
Cartographers.  What if you are both a super cool cartographer and a
whiz bang C++ developer?  Why aren't you here already?

But what about me?

Yes, there is a chance that you can still participate.  While we have
limited space in both London and San Francisco, some spots are still
available.  If you would like to attend please confirm your spot by
mailing me directly.  If you can't attend either London or San
Francisco you will be missing some of the fun but not all of it.
We'll be on #mapnik IRC and the mapniik-dev@ list during the event as
well.  Feel free to join from afar.

What are we doing?

A code sprint, or hack fest, is a period of software development
focused on a given list of goals. Committers and Cartographers is a
free and open three-day event for the improvement of the Mapnik code
base.  The face to face meeting will let us approach complex topics
with immediate feedback.  We'll see lots of bug-fixes and some new
features tagged as #msc1 after the event is over.

The goals for Committers and Cartographers are:

- Cartography Improvements - Discuss and defeat some tricky
cartography requests.  There may be others but those highlighted by
Steve Chilton in the SotM talk are a good start.

- Squash bugs - we'll be squashing bugs as fast as we can.  Be sure to
file any bugs that have been pestering you.

Future Mapnik Code Sprints

Based on the anticipated success of this first Mapnik Code Sprint, we
plan to have more.  And if you have been toying with the idea of
participating this time, you know you'll want to join in next time for
sure.


Best regards,
Richard


[1] well, at the same time, but with time zones and stuff in the way,
so on the same days.
[2] where &quot;cast of thousands&quot; approaches a dozen.
[3] where &quot;huge robot army&quot; approaches a cool group of coders and designers.
