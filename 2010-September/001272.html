</I>
Cascadenik can also only address it by creating dozens of layers, for 
each possible layer=*. I'd like to see variables and loops become a 
possibility in the stylesheet, so I can iterate over the layer=* tags, 
by calling the same styles but with different layer=* values in the 
datasource.

</I>
If the new expression engine allows to set the width of a 
LineSymbolizer, then yeah, we can already do it in trunk.

The issue is that you'd have sudden changes in line width where the 
canal width tag changes. It should create a small tapering section in 
those spots.

&gt;<i> Ah, yeah. Okay I have another idea for this as well, based on nodes and their location within street networks. Most mapnik stylesheets use round caps and joins because it's the only reliable way to prevent jags and notches in rendered streets, but square caps and joins have the potential to be much better-looking. If we could see how a line bumps into other lines, it'd be possible to make street networks that don't these problems:

The other example is where differently classed roads meet in a T, and 
the fill of the rising bar protrudes into the top bar. If you understand 
what I mean there.
