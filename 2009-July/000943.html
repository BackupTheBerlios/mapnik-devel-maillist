</I>Hi all,

Thanks for the commit bit! I was having a hard time keeping my sanity 
with all these patches lying around ;)

Well, I've just created a &quot;gdalcolors&quot; branch and applied the patch. It 
still lacks some cleanup, docs and tests which I hope to finish soon. I 
must admit I'm not too happy with the patch as it is right now as some 
parts are really &quot;hacky, partly due to my C++ inexperience and partly 
because it seems (from my c++ newbie POV)  that mapnik was never 
designed to display raw raster data.

Anyway, this patch shows it's possible and I'm pretty sure that a little 
bit of refactoring could make this functionality fit-in more cleanly. I 
hope I can get some help guiding me on how to best introduce some 
changes in mapnik to better support raster data.

Some of these, from the top of my head:

* To make best use of any overviews the featureset needs to know the 
geographic extent and the image size as it was requested to the Map. 
Currently it derives this information by peeking into the query object 
(the patch makes it available to the featureset) to look at the 
resolution but this is sub-optimal because the resolution is calculated 
out of the intersection of the requested extent and the layer's extent. 
Would it be possible to make the original extent and image size 
available to the featureset somehow? Perhaps the query object could 
carry this information too?

* The raw data from the GdalBand is passed from the featureset down to 
the symbolizer casted as a float into the ImageData32's int buffer and 
then casted back. This is ugly but it works, at least with 32 bit data. 
I yet have no use-case of it but perhaps some folks will need to display 
Float64 data but it's not possible ATM (without incurring in yet more 
horrible hacks). Any ideas on how to extend the ImageData (?) to be able 
to carry other datatypes?

Finally a little bit of background about the itch I'm trying to scratch 
with these patches: I'm in the process of migrating the rendering engine 
of a GIS webapp we're working on which currently uses mapscript to 
mapnik due to the beautiful maps it makes, a (much) nicer python API and 
its ability to load the styles from an XML file which will allow the 
people in charge of administering the app to style the maps themselves 
and stop bothering me all the time ;)

This app is used mostly to display meteorological and other data we 
derive from the meteo. one to aid in the wild forest fire-fighting in 
Spain (we're unfortunately having a terrible summer so far with 14 
active fires in this very moment :( )
Since 99% of this data is raster based this functionality is essential 
for us to be able to use mapnik as the main rendering engine.

Cheers,
Alberto

P.S I've created another &quot;arrowsymbolizer&quot; branch with an 
ArrowSymbolizer we use to render arrows to visualize wind 
speed/direction and fireline intensity/direction. Perhaps this can be 
useful to others working in a similar domain as us, or just to have fun 
;). Though I have briefly mentioned this to Dane I didn't get any 
explicit permission to upload it so if there's any problem (perhaps it's 
too specialized for mapnik's audience?) don't hesitate to tell me an 
I'll remove it immediately
