<PRE>Dane,

Your zoom_all() idea maybe the best solution.  If I understand 
correctly, you would create a new method which returns an envelope 
representing the extents of all layers in the map's projection, say 
'all_extents' (only every needs to be invoked once).  Then in 
apply_to_layer, use the 'all_extents' value to clip the buffered_extents 
before transforming to the layer's projection.  The transformed result 
would most likely be valid and now the test and subsequent clipping of 
the query bbox should yield good values. I'll give it a try and see what 
happens.

Depending on when you are planning to release 0.7.0, reverting r1348 is 
a better choice for now. 

My reasoning is that the original code transforms the layer's extents to 
the map's projection and is more likely to produce a valid result 
because the layer's extents most likely valid and transformable.

With the r1348 version, the buffered extents are transformed to the 
layer's projection and normally this would seem to be ok.  However, 
since the buffered extents are simply a linear extrapolation of the 
map's current extents, and if the map's current extents are at or near 
the valid limits for its projection, then the buffered extents are most 
likely invalid.  Consequently transforming them to the layer's 
projection is going to cause unpredictable results.  Hence the bbox 
limits may be corrupted and valid geometries are dropped (missing).

Anytime a transform is performed, there exists the chance that the 
result is going to be invalid, there needs to be a way to determine if a 
transformation is going to yield a valid result and adjust processing as 
appropriate.  Using proj4 api, the only way I can see to do this is to 
transform forward and backwards (or backward and forward) and see if the 
result matches the original.  Its better to affect mapnik's processing 
than to silently drop features due to a transformation problem.
