<PRE>&gt;<i> I appreciate your 'difficult journey' as another mac user. There  
</I>&gt;<i> have been a growing number of new folks coming to mapnik on the mac  
</I>&gt;<i> platform, and yes, I agree the platform-specific documentation could  
</I>&gt;<i> be better. I too got hung up originally on that macports boost  
</I>&gt;<i> variant catch.
</I>
I'm sorely tempted to create a macport so it's easier for the next  
person....

</I>
Thanks, I just saw it. I'll post detailed notes including patches on  
my blog, and I'll definitely refine that page.

(I don't want to go into the why/how of my fixes on the trac, hence  
the blog)

&gt;<i> In terms of your 'TypeError' you'll find that listed as on  
</I>&gt;<i> unresolved issue on mac install guide. There is another user that  
</I>&gt;<i> has been trying to work past that for a while now and I have not  
</I>&gt;<i> heard of a solution (yet).
</I>
Found it. It's a bad python version. The Apple Python frameworks go  
into /System/Library/Frameworks, while user-installed Python  
frameworks go into /Library/Frameworks.

The boost port is forced against /System/Library, while mapnik builds  
against the first available Python library. Workaround - remove the  
frameworks in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework

Mapnik is now working fine for me, although documentation is still  
sparse ;)

&gt;<i> Hopefully one of the core devs will be able to take a look at the  
</I>&gt;<i> issue in closer detail soon. My only hunch is that is has something  
</I>&gt;<i> do do with multiple versions of python/boost installed with fink.
</I>
Your hunch is absolutely correct.  You can verify it by setting  
DYLD_PRINT_APIS in the shell environmet before you run a python script.

&gt;<i> I'd recommend you file a ticket on the trac site (<A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/register">https://trac.mapnik.org/register</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> ) for that issue and another separate issues addressed by your  
</I>&gt;<i> patches.
</I>
If I get around to it, I'll refile the patches. I strongly suggest the  
developers switch to git or a similar version control system though -  
that eases submission of patches for both sides.

  - Robert
