<PRE>I invested many hours to draw a initial map of Laos und Cambodia.

In both countries it is possible to buy maps with English writing system 
- but NO maps with local writing system are available.
A cambodian map (english letters) is available at every guesthouse, 
restaurant,... in Seam Reap and Phnom Penh for free.

If you show the map to local people and ask for way, the people can't 
help you.

The reason:
1.) The problem is, that the people have never seen a map of their 
country. There are no maps at school.
2.) All maps are in english - made for rich tourists. Local people can't 
read english.

It could be very cheap to print a map of their country for all the 
school children in Laos and Cambodia, but if nobody makes this
map, there is nothing to print.

I started to make the Laos and Cambodia map and used Lao and Khmer 
writing system for all written things on the map.
But there are so many problems!

1.) Potlatch shows only rectangles instead of letters.
2.) <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-devel">tiles at home</A> works if all fonts are installed - but if somebody 
rerenders the tile, the text is gone. There are also many rendering 
mistakes even if the font is installed.
3.) Mapnik doesn't support Chinese, Japanese, Khmer, Thai, Myanmar,...

It would be so easy to install the fonts but the responsible people just 
don't do it.
Asian people are a little different. They take care, that you don't 
loose your face - but they don't use openstreetmap if it is not working.

The result of this mess
==============
There are nearly no roads entered in China, Japan, ...
If there are roads, the work is done by tourists.
The tourists start to enter the geographical names in english und ignor 
the local language.
If the map is in english instead of chinese, japanese, thai, khmer,... 
the local people will ignor this map - for ever.

Look for example Thailand Chang Mai:
<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=18.78813&amp;lon=98.98849&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=B0FT">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=18.78813&amp;lon=98.98849&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=B0FT</A>
Everything is english. If there are no tourists - as in 90% of Thailand 
- there will be no map.
The same starts in Cambodia, Siam Reap.

Sorry, but that's like in the old colonial days.

If the fonts are installed, there are still many problems to solve. In 
Lao and Khmer (the languages I can read) there are many rendering 
problems to solve.

--
This problem is a CRITICAL problem. The data entered to openstreetmap 
are wrong. The &quot;name&quot; attribute should be the local name - but if this 
is not possible, people use english instead - which is simply WRONG!



How to solve the problem:
================
Install the fonts!!!!
