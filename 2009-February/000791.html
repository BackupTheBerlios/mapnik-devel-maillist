&gt;&gt;<i> As part of an application I am developing to allow users to generate Mapnik tiles from .osm files, or from live data via OSMXAPI, on their home machines &gt;&gt;(allowing their web server to be very lightweight and just serve static tiles with no Postgres installation necessary), I would like to render tiles directly from &gt;&gt;a stream of OSM data sent back from a URL. However there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to do this with the Mapnik plugin architecture. Has &gt;&gt;anyone come across this sort of problem and developed their own solution or had thoughts on it?

&gt;<i>Didn't you write an OSM plugin for mapnik? So surely it's just a question of extending that plugin to support URLs as well as files as the source? Using &gt;libcurl or something is probably the easiest way to do that.
</I>
Yes that's probably the best approach come to think of it. Was thinking about it a slightly different way, i.e. passing an input stream into mapnik, rather than actually opening the connection to the URL from within the plugin.

&gt;<i>BTW, where are you expecting to stream this data from exactly?
</I>
Was thinking of osmxapi. The idea of this app is not so much that people can render huge areas at home, but rather, smaller areas like their county, or similar; it seems to me that seeing that server facilities (notably postgres support) is the biggest hurdle people are likely to come up with if they want to render their own Mapnik based map and home rendering is the best way of getting round this.
