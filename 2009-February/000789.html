<PRE>Hello everyone,

As part of an application I am developing to allow users to generate Mapnik tiles from .osm files, or from live data via OSMXAPI, on their home machines (allowing their web server to be very lightweight and just serve static tiles with no Postgres installation necessary), I would like to render tiles directly from a stream of OSM data sent back from a URL. However there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to do this with the Mapnik plugin architecture. Has anyone come across this sort of problem and developed their own solution or had thoughts on it?

True, I can dump the response in a .osm and then read it in, but would be nicer to render from the data streamed back directly :-)

Thanks,
Nick
