Can you point at the code in question? The bit I think you are talking
about is converting from a Cairo ImageSurface to an Image32 and I
believe it is useful to keep this code in Mapnik. 

Without this there is no bridge between an image rendered by the Mapnik
Cairo renderer and other internal routines which only operate on an
Image32. This, for example, makes it trivial to use the png256 support
code with the Cairo renderer.

Perhaps in the future this will allow us to render SVG symbols with
Cairo and then use these as an Image32 in the Agg renderer.


&gt;<i> Doing that for all sorts of graphic libs isn't useful. So the idea is
</I>&gt;<i> to remove the cairo support and better provide functions to convert the

</I>
I disagree with removing the Cairo code as I mentioned above. I think
Cairo support deserves special support because it is one of the two core
rendering engines.

I think we should add more generic internal routines to support import /
export of simple standard image formats but I don't think that means we
should remove &quot;convenience&quot; functions that make it easy to convert data
between libraries without needing the user to understand the intricacies
of the different buffer layouts.

&gt;<i> Then we could provide examples how to use that raw data in various
</I>&gt;<i> graphical toolkit (like e.g. cairo or Evas).
</I>
Example are always good.

Most users do not care how the raw data is formatted and would rather
get the Mapnik image into Evas, Pycairo, PIL, GEGL or whatever without
needing to understand the details. If Mapnik can provide support code to
interface to multiple image libraries then I see this as providing extra
value. 

The code does not need to be in the core Mapnik routines, maybe it can
become additional type of binding or plugin.
