Message-ID: <44BA4514.9090708@fsfe.org>

Hello all

i've created a gentoo ebuild for building and installing mapnik on 
gentoo boxes
Please get it from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140599

I had to patch che SConstruct files in order to allow users to change 
optimization level and to make the scons procedure NOT create ANY file 
outside what in gentoo is called the "sandbox" (the safe place where 
ebuilds are build before being integrated into the system)

OK and now a question: I dunno if you have used SWIG for the python 
bindings but I wanted you to use it because that easily leaded to the 
creation of java bindings, that are what I'm looking for.

I've dedicated two hours to java bindings using swig (in the manual the 
way I've followed is called "SWIG for the truly lazy") but I wasn't 
successfull.

Attached you find the tiny swig interface created and here is the 
command use to wrap it with swig
cd bindings/java
swig -v -java -c++ -I../../include -I/usr/include Map.i

This lead to buildable but incomplete Map.java class. In particular the 
following error occurs
../../include/map.hpp:92: Error: Syntax error in input(1).

Hope this could help someone, and that someone could help me ;)

Bye

Federico,

Excellent!  Always good to have easy ways to install mapnik :)

Unfortunately, it seems your patches only apply to Gentoo.  I see you've 
switched fro using PYTHON_PREFIX to PREFIX ... which is bizarre, the 
python system is fairly strict in it's file system layout.  Why doesn't 
PYTHON_PREFIX work?

Also, what kind of problems do you get with -O3?

As for SWIG ... I don't think anyone has played with it yet ... very 
interesting idea however.  For Python/C++, Boost.Python is prefered.  If 
there's demand for other languages, then great!  Ideally someday it 
would be nice to incoporate the SWIG stuff into the standard 
distribution IMO.

The way you're doing it may be over simplistic however ... I'm not 
surprised it doesn't work!  That might also generate as rather 
unintuitive API for the Java programmer.

Unfortunately, I fail to see what the problem is on line 92 of map.hpp 
... it's pretty straightforward.  The previous line is a virtual 
declaration, maybe SWIG doesn't support that?

Overall, I'm not sure how good C++ support is in SWIG (I've played with 
it for C with success mind you ... but C++?).

Basically I look at SWIG as a lazy approach ... a little too generic, 
especially in the OO world.  Have you considered writing a JNI 
interface?  This would allow a much more java-esque integration I'm 
betting ... better in the long run.  But then I don't know squat about 
Java :)

Indeed it is a gentoo need. For security reasons, afaik gentoo ebuilds 
are made of two main steps. The first one is where your ebuild does the 
job (unpacking, patching, compiling...): in this step you create the 
exact folder tree into a safe sandbox (that is a temp folder), just as 
you were installing on root folder.
The second one is made by the emerge utility that takes your "installed" 
folder tree, reads it, creates a file list and copies it into the root 
folder.
You as the ebuild creator cannot allow your makefiles to write files 
outside the sandbox or emerge will complain interrupting the build process.

Absolutely no problem, but in Gentoo things like optimization levels and 
gcc flags are user settings. Anyway this is just a pre-pre-pre-alpha 
ebuild: it compiles what is needed but still misses something (the 
examples, for example, should have a dedicated "use" flag)

Sure of that! I don't know swig but some of its features. I was giving 
it a try and failed :p

The main reason I was considering SWIG is for its need of an interface 
file from which it can create bindings for python, java and so on. It 
seems a way to do the things once for all. But I agree it can't be so 
easy and clean. I will take a look at the JNI thing as soon as possible.

Bye

Federico
