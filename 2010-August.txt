Hi Robert,

Thanks for the work you did to the branch! I tried it a bit this weekend and
gave it a shot to add some support to mapnik2 constructors. I also added
some support for postgis and shape types of datasources so that I could
render the style.mml that comes bundled with Cascadenik, though I don't know
if that was the right approach. I'm attaching the diff and hello world
script that I used to play with the branch.

Regards,

- Waldemar

Hi Robert,

I just wanted to say thank you for picking this up! It was always my intent to finish the branch, but hours in the day blah blah blah. =)

I'm thrilled that someone finds these rough beginnings useful enough to take them a few steps further.

Now, to bring it all up-to-date with Mapnik 0.7. Dane, what's your opinion on moving Cascadenik to Git?

-mike.

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] trunk rev2101, compiling with msvc8 is extremely slow
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP4465B58C87F7AA29F9DB00CEAE0@phx.gbl>

hi list,
I checked out the latest mapnik2 trunk(rev2101), and imported it into a 
vs2005 project. But the compilation was extremely slow (over 1 hour). 
The compiler just kept asking for more memory, and somtimes ended up 
with out of heap space(depends on system loads).
Compiling some cpp like "filter_factory.cpp" took more than 5 minutes 
and over 1G ram. On some low end pc with ram less than 1G, this will 
simply crash the compiler for out of heap space.

The Boost is the latest 1.43.0.
My pc: vista, e2180 at 2ghz, 2G ram

Regards, zsj

Personally I'm working in git (via git-svn) already.

At the moment my goals are to:
 - fix some bugs I've identified
 - implement all the selectors available in 0.7.x in both trunk & the branch
 - figure out how to implement support for mapnik2 from the same codebase
 - get -xmlbad merged to become the new trunk :)

Rob :)

Mike and I chatted today and we propose moving cascadenik, nikweb, nik2img, etc to the newly created:

http://github.com/mapnik

Each would have its own repository. Ideally we would do this:

1) After merging xml-bad into trunk at the existing SVN repo at google code (http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/)
2) Keeping svn history (using git-svn for the conversion to github)

Note: I created http://github.com/mapnik with a move like this in mind - as a staging location for tools that one day might be part of Mapnik core. To be clear I DO NOT intend for the mapnik codebase proper to be at github (it will stay where it is).

Thoughts?

Dane

zsj,

Yes, Mapnik trunk uses boost::spirit, which takes an enormous amount of memory to compile grammers for. I've never seen compile times over 25 minutes however, for the whole codebase. Normally I see 15-20 minute compile times on a machine with 2GB ram.

It also makes sense that filter_factory.cpp takes a longer time to compile that other files at it pulls in #include <mapnik/expression_grammar.hpp> which is the file containing boost::spirit grammers.

It sounds like msvc8 is much slower than g++ - have you tried compiling with mingw at all?

 Dane

I agree with this idea. Robert, can you explain a bit about how you're using git-svn? Are you mirroring the whole thing, branches-and-all, or just the Cascadenik subdirectory? My git-svn experience has been positive but limited.

Dane I see I'm a member of the organization on Github, what's the procedure for setting up new projects?

I think I just need to give you "admin" access, which I've now done. Does it appear you have the ability to create repos now?

Rob, do you have a github account?

Hm, it doesn't seem like it. At least, I can't find a place to do it that isn't on my personal user dashboard.

switch context > mapnik

should result in a black "new repository" button just below the "switch context button"

no go?

Of ... course. "Switch Context." =P

Do you have access to:

https://github.com/mapnik/Cascadenik/edit

I seem to, so I added the "Mapnik Developer team" which everyone will be a part of...

Thanks for learning this with me! :)

hi, Dane
Have to say compilation with boost::spirit for complex grammar is really painful. One of the author has suggested some guidelines here(http://boost-spirit.com/home/articles/doc-addendum/best-practices/), but seems not so helpful.
Comparing to spirit::classic, the compilation time is much longer and memory usage is much higher.
Furthermore, I think spirit::classic also has a handy character iterator facility. For example, an icu based iterator can accept any byte stream encoded in icu supported codepage, and feed ucs2 or ucs4 code to the spirit parser. That is much better than the current codepage namespace solution.

Switching to msvc9, compilation of mapnik took about 30 minutes. Seems 
msvc9 is able to processes complex template more effectively. Compiling 
with mingw3.81 from qt creator also took similar time. But the memory 
usage is still very high.

I agree, and we're certainly open to ideas to improve usage of boost::spirit2 to speed things up.

Thanks for this link.

Yes, certainly spirit::classic did not have such slow compile times. Hopefully as spirit2 develops the boost devs can improve things (and that blog post give more examples for grammars).

That is great news. Also, the clang++ compiler is able to compile Mapnik in around 14 minutes (half the time of gcc) on mac osx. However, it is not quite ready for primetime as it still has a few bugs, particularly on linux.

Okay, good to know. It would be great if you could document your steps in the wiki a bit? Could you?

So, this is alive:

Are your goals in order? What do you think about merging xmlbad back to trunk first, and then we can split the other work via Github?

My goals were in order, but they were mine ;) Sharing wins hands down.

As long as you guys are happy with the stability of it (or saying HEAD
is potentially unstable for a while), I'd say go for it.

I'm using the branch in anger, but I'm only applying styles to Map
objects and not generating XML except for any tests I do while coding.

The only issue I haven't looked at yet is whether local caching of
downloaded images/etc is working right (I have a feeling it's not, but
I haven't actually checked).

Rob :)

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] load_map/save_map
Message-ID: <op.vhax2ngui35s77@sl500.localnetwork>

Currently load_map and save_map are toplevel functions, but I think they
would  better be member functions of "Map".
map.save("output.xml") seems much more logical than
mapnik2.save_map(map, "output.xml")

The attached patch adds these functions to the map object, but also keeps
the old syntax.

I wanted to know if somebody has objections against this. If everybody
likes it I'm going to commit it soon, but I'm asking first as this changes
the API.

Cheers,

Hermann

Message-ID: <AANLkTikTS0oduJh5MFvETQU4oJvhB_i+a_ESDPrcheJ5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
with great help received from Dane, I run paleoserver+tirex instance
with Planet content.

Paleoserver itself: http://osm-wms.maps.nottingham.ac.uk/

Through tirex: var diskcache = [

	"http://south.world.maps.nottingham.ac.uk/tiles/osmwms/${z}/${x}/${y}.png",
	
"http://east.world.maps.nottingham.ac.uk/tiles/osmwms/${z}/${x}/${y}.png",
	
"http://west.world.maps.nottingham.ac.uk/tiles/osmwms/${z}/${x}/${y}.png",
	
"http://north.world.maps.nottingham.ac.uk/tiles/osmwms/${z}/${x}/${y}.png"
       		 ];
It works, but... :-)

1) without GetFeatures capabilities paleoserver itself is useless for
Qgis users, which is IMHO the most interested in WMS

2) tirex unfortunately translates WMS into tiles, so it is not WMS
anymore, although it os confirmed now it caches data and keeps the
load very efficiently.

IMHO although paleoserver is a step forward from wms.py, as it can use
all cores, the above cons are needed to be resolved before it could be
useful for any production service.

Thanks again for help to set up this experiment,
Serge

Have you considered mod_mapnik_wms 
(http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mod_mapnik_wms)?

I'm not sure why you would be using tirex. You say it "unfortunately 
translates WMS into tiles", but serving tiles is the whole *purpose* of 
tirex so if you don't want tiles, don't use tirex!

Frederik

Hi Frederik
No, I will try, thanks for pointing out.

Because of load management, using any such a service without load
management is IMHO useless, as the usage is unpredictable. I did not
read properly the documentation I had expected it would serve a clean
WMS, just caching and load limiting.

Thanks,
Serge

I apologize for the lack of notice, but mapnik.org (as well as trac and svn) are down today, due to an abrupt server move, but expected to be up again tomorrow.
