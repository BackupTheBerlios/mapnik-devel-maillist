<PRE>get_ideal_placements currently contains code for handling 
POINT_PLACEMENT and LINE_PLACEMENT with label_spacing &gt; 0, however it is 
never used in these cases.

If you edit the statements in:
   void agg_renderer&lt;T&gt;::process(text_symbolizer const&amp; sym,
                                 Feature const&amp; feature,
                                 proj_transform const&amp; prj_trans)
to use get_ideal_placements (via 
finder.find_placements&lt;path_type&gt;(text_placement,path); ) in the 
label_spacing &gt; 0 case, it seems to perform fine (at least in my small 
test, the placements themselves were different however)

What benefits/differences is find_placements_with_spacing providing over 
find_placements + get_ideal_placements? (or vice versa)
_with_spacing is a lot more complicated, but I can only assume it is 
doing something better?
There seems to be code in _with_spacing to support displacement and some 
extra character placement checks, does this mean displacement doesn't 
work if label_spacing == 0 ?

It looks that we could replace these similar sets of functionality with 
a single code path to handle both cases (with and without 
label_spacing), as without label_spacing should just be a subset of with?

I'll look into implementing this tomorrow if no one has any reasons why not.

It does look like some of this code is currently WIP, anyone have any 
plans in relation to text placement?
Artem: Does the current text placement code work correctly with the 
smoothing/curves support you are working on? Or have you done some 
modifications in there?

Thanks.
Dave.
