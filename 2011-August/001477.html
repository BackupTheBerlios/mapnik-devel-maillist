&gt;<i> hi list:

Yes. While it adds compile time, the idea is to have faster runtimes, so I feel like this is a worthwhile tradeoff as long as your machine has a modern spec of &gt; 2 cores and 2 gb memory. With that spec Mapnik, with new spirit goodness should take 6-8 minutes to compile which seems absolutely fine. 

&gt;<i> the generated code seems to be dramatically bloated.
</I>
I have not seen this to be the case. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For my case:
</I>&gt;<i> mapnik(trunk) on msvc9/10 generates 800MB pdb file in debug mode and 400MB in release mode,
</I>
I have been building osx binaries recently with libmapnik statically compiled against all dependencies (including boost) and that lib totals 8 mb. 

I'm not familiar with pdb files - they are for debugging? Msvc must keep around much more than is needed?

For my development all I tend to need is a release build with the -g flag for gdb, but I like minimal likely more than most. 

&gt;<i> and compiling takes around 20 minutes with 1GB+ ram.
</I>
Are you frequently compiling Mapnik? Maybe try clang - is takes 6-8 minutes. 


&gt;<i> Any project, even just including those headers, could be blotted to 10MB binary.
</I>
Can you provide an example?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure if this is the only case for msvc.
</I>
It's important we do our best with any compiler. If you could provide some code samples perhaps we could try some flags to hide inlines to reduce sizes. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should place the &quot;boost/spirit&quot; related stuff more carefully, avoiding too many includes in one single unit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also as the release note said: Spirit offers BOOST_SPIRIT_NO_PREDEFINED_TERMINALS to prevent instantiations of predefined terminal objects which slows down compile time a lot, as a breaking change in Boost 1.47.0.
</I>
Cool. I'll take a look at this, thanks.
