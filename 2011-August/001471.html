<PRE>Hi all,

I've been playing with generating heatmap (and other raster) layers
directly from within Mapnik instead of relying on the mish-mash of
tools that seem to typically brought to bear to accomplish these types
of things.  The work is here:

   <A HREF="https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-rasterizers">https://github.com/stellaeof/mapnik-rasterizers</A>

While the approach does basically work, it left me pondering extension
points for Mapnik beyond the current input datasources.  What I really
wanted was something like one of the following but I ended up settling
for a raster datasource for lack of any other option:

   1. Some kind of a &quot;Layer Plugin&quot; that would give me access to more
of the render state and just hand off to me to take it all from there.
   2. Some kind of pluggable symbolizer that has life-cycle methods
that let me manage some state across an entire featureset and then
lets me access the rendering context whenever I want to in order to
paint my output.

I know why these types of things would be bad from the perspective
that Mapnik works hard to shield the data manipulation bits from the
backend rendering bits (agg/cairo, et al).  I'm not sure how we could
satisfy both concerns or whether there is enough other use cases to
justify such thoughts.  I figured I'd throw it out there for
discussion, though.

The key thing about this type of output is that you need all of the
data for an area before you start to paint.  In that way it acts more
like an aggregate function vs a set returning function.  Once you've
tabulated all of the data, you transform it globally and then colorize
it.  The overall approach is all contained in the
heatmap_datasource.cpp file in the heatmap_datasource::rasterize
method.

Does anyone have thoughts on a better way to approach this kind of problem?

- stella
