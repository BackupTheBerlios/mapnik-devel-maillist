Hi all,

In a WMS request, when bbox ratio and image ratio do not match, ogcserver/mapnik will just show more area instead of streching the image. This does not work ok when trying to use the wms image in Google Earth. While this is solved properly, here is a patch to ogcserver/common.py to make it work:

    def GetMap(self, params):
        # HACK: check if the image should be strechted
        bbox_ratio = float(params['bbox'][2] - params['bbox'][0]) / float(params['bbox'][3] - params['bbox'][1])
        image_ratio = float(params['width']) / float(params['height'])
        img_height = params['height']
        resize = False
        if int(bbox_ratio * 100) != int(image_ratio * 100):
            params['height'] = int(params['height'] / bbox_ratio)
            resize = True

        m = self._buildMap(params)
        im = Image(params['width'], params['height'])
        render(m, im)
        format = PIL_TYPE_MAPPING[params['format']]
        if resize:
            from PIL import Image as PILImage
            size = params['width'], params['height']
            im = PILImage.open(StringIO(im.tostring(format)))
            size = params['width'], img_height
            im = im.resize(size)
            output = StringIO()
            im.save(output, format=format)
            return Response(params['format'].replace('8',''), output.getvalue())
        return Response(params['format'].replace('8',''), im.tostring(format))

This is a violation of the WMS specification which explicitly mandates 
that the image must be stretched in this case.

The mod_mapnik_wms server (available from OpenStreetMap SVN) does this 
right - compare

http://full.wms.geofabrik.de/std/demo_key?LAYERS=&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG%3A4326&BBOX=7.4403,46.9495,7.4485,46.95560&WIDTH=382&HEIGHT=300

and

http://full.wms.geofabrik.de/std/demo_key?LAYERS=&FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG%3A4326&BBOX=7.4403,46.9495,7.4485,46.95560&WIDTH=382&HEIGHT=200

- but it uses a very primitive image scaling (omitting or doubling 
scanlines as required) which leads to less eye-pleasing results than the 
proper scaling that you have implemented.

The best way to handle this currently is to call Mapnik with an 
aspect_fix_mode of "ADJUST_CANVAS_HEIGHT" instead of the default which 
is GROW_BBOX; Mapnik will then return an image that covers exactly the 
bounding box requested but may not have the correct pixel height. Then 
you have to stretch or shrink the image vertically to fit the height you 
wanted.

I am unsure if your patch does this because I cannot see it changing the 
aspect_fix_mode at all - but maybe that's elsewhere in the code.

I guess what you are looking for is something like an aspect_fix_mode of 
"SCALE_IMAGE_TO_FIT" but that doesn't exist as far as I know.

The WMS specification does BTW not say what should happen to fonts etc. 
in this situation. Imagine you make a WMS request and specify twice the 
height that it would "normally" have. Now our scaling approach would 
generate lettering with the wrong aspect ratio and all sorts of other 
ugliness (vertical roads would be half as wide as horizontal roads etc). 
One would prefer to somehow, instead of scaling the result, influence 
Mapnik's projection by adding a vertical scale factor directly into the 
projection code. That would then lead to the desired double-height image 
with a good look. However, I have a suspicion that WMS allows this kind 
of non-matching width to accommodate displays that have non-square 
pixels; and for such cases - i.e. imagine you have a display where each 
pixel is twice as wide as it is high - you'd really want to have the 
"wrong" aspect ratio in the image so that it looks right on your screen.

Bye
Frederik

Hi Frederik,

The code is just asking mapnik to render into a smaller image, then the image is streched to the requested size, not optimal, but it works. As you said text is the most afected feature.

Because of the reasons you explain perhaps it is not worth it, and the current suboptimal solutions are ok.

Manel.
