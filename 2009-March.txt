Message-ID: <075B4924-9875-4468-85A1-A8B1A5273C62@hailmail.net>

Dev,

With r1000 I've updated the CHANGELOG back to around the time of the  
last release.

http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/999
http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1000

It would be great if you could correct any unclear notes or expand on  
the changes where appropriate.

But, most of all please from now on attach a new CHANGELOG message  
along with EACH commit to trunk for any notable changes to the API,  
for new functionality, or major tickets closed that affect usability.

Thanks!

Dane

Message-ID: <q_tIGIXTW0-6To8P-qls4a6UAaqcbq2Gw0nmVDNOANGC-u6kd0oscBkEg8Tb3oUr@cipher.nrlssc.navy.mil>



Hi, I'd mentioned before that I was going to be working on a plugin for some 
of our custom datatypes. I've been able to write a basic plugin that will read 
a text file containing the various point, lines, polygons that I want to plot 
on a map.  What I have not been able to figure out is how to apply filtering to 
the text dataset (or any new dataset I have) like I have been doing with the 
shapefiles -- rule1.set_filter(create_filter()). Does the filtering get applied 
using the boost libraries filter template or is it somewhere else?

Also, I haven't yet figured out how to put text on the maps that I produce 
using my input plugin. Can someone just point me in the direction I should 
look for that?

Is there any sort of data flow description for the mapnik toolkit that might be 
of help to me??? For some of this, I've been able to make it work, but I don't 
totally understand why it works.

Thanks,
Edward Braithwaite

Yes, all filtering is implementing in code library. For this to work
properly you need to ensure that features you return in  featureset
next() method have all relevant properties set. You should use
mapnik::query object to get a list of required properties.

This is directly related to how you create features (see above).

I'm afraid we don't have a detailed data flow,yet. I think the best is
to study the source and post here. Also, there is a #mapnik IRC
channel where someone might be able to help.

Hello,

I'm planning to develop a plugin that uses a TCP socket.

Would you prefer an implementation in SVN that uses plain socket
functions and maybe some little #ifdef WIN32 where needed or the usage
of boost_asio?

Ok, I'm getting a little closer on the filtering and labels. Your reply sent me 
in the right direction. Thanks.

Now I have a different problem.
Some of the polygons we use have an outer ring and an inner ring...much like a 
donut. The inner ring basically punched a hole in the polygon and the 
background should be visible...can this be done with mapnik? Can someone point 
me in the right direction?

Thanks,
Edward

not the boost::asio version is included in Ubuntu. This leads me to use
plain sockets for the plugin. Maybe later if boost::asio is better

That should work fine. These are supported in the postgis plugin too.
They are created via the code in the WKB reader, see read_polygon() in
src/wkb.cpp. Each ring is added via a move_to + several line_to.

Andreas,

suppose, you should verify if asio has these bugs, describe your problem
here - maybe someone will help you(I'll be unavailable at least next 3-4
weeks) - don't run into platform dependency now, if there is no different
ways. You also can post tickets to boost team - it will prevent some tickets
for you in __future__ ;)

Cheers

Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Plugin features not showing
Message-ID: <20090315172818.022a5838@frodo.mittelerde>

Hello,

I created a small plugin that should display a point feature on the
map. Here is a small stripped down example:

http://tux-style.de/tmp/mapnik-kismet/mapnik_kismet.tar.gz

Currently I create the icon at a static position on the map for
testing. If I render the map at this position it's not shown and I
don't understand why. It seems something is missing. Could you please
help me?

In the file are also two XML files available which I use for testing.

From debugging I see that the featureset_ptr is filled and returned.

Any ideas?

regards
Andreas

Ok, meanwhile I found out that my example coordinates were in the
wrong format. If I use mercator then it seems to work. :-)

Hello,

I thought about a birdview in mapnik. Have plans to develop such a
feature? I don't talk about 3D maps.

In the first idea I would simply scale the map image to generate a
z-axis. The icon layer I wouldn't do that as I expect it to look
strange. There I would scale each icon itself regarding it's "z-axis"
and then draw it.

What do you think?

Hello,

I've just commited a new input plugin for kismet support. I added a Makefile.am
for myself. If you need a SConstruct file please add one yourself.

Features:
---------
* Connects to a running kismet_server with GPS support activated
* Displays little WLAN icons on the map.

TODO / Problems:
----------------
* Should show WPA/WEP/OPEN WLAN with a different icon
* Reconnect to kismet_server after disconnect
* Bounding box envelope isn't used
* Only shows live found WLAN (no memory/database storage)

Use this minimal XML to display it. For real cases you should integrate
it into your big XML:

You could use this icon if you like. I think it fits well:

Today I drove around for some time in my car and it looks really nice. :-)

My battery was empty before I had a chance to capture a video. But I hope
to try this again in the next days.

Go out and test the new plugin if you like. I'm really interested in your experiences.

regards
Andreas

So you need to do this in a XML file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Map>

      <PointSymbolizer file = "/home/andreas/src/osm/mapnik/symbols/wlan.png" type="png" width="32" height="32" />
      <TextSymbolizer name="name" face_name="DejaVu Sans Bold" size="8" fill="#636" dy="-10" halo_radius="1" wrap_width="0"/>
    </Rule>
  </Style>

<!-- Layer -->

  <Layer name="kismet" status="on" srs="+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84">

      <Parameter name="type">kismet</Parameter>

      <Parameter name="extent">-179,-85,179,85</Parameter>

BTW: Am I allowed to list and document it here[1] as it's not yet released?

Mapnik-dev,

In prep for the 0.6.0 release, I've replaced the old 'docs/epydocs'  
folder in trunk with a newly generated set of HTML api docs generated  
with epydoc.

These are still woefully lacking in proper docstrings for many  
important classes, but I've worked hard to start on method and  
property docstrings for at least the Map [1] and Layer [2] classes  
(see the bottom of their pages), and the major functions, which appear  
on the main page here:

http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/docs/api_docs/python/index.html

Awesome, nice work. The python interface documentation has been
somewhat lacking  :)

Mvg,

Hey Nick,

Osm plugin is looking good. Do you think you could take a look at:

http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/275

Thanks,
Dane

Hey Lucio,

Do you think you could quickly write up some docstrings for the OCCI  
plugin?

http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/274

Also would be great if you could review what I added for the OGR plugin.

Thanks!

Dane
