</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, I see - thanks for the explanation. Perhaps Artem or Dominic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will have ideas about the best way to package. Your idea of two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different packages sounds good to me.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that since Dane's good work recently I don't see much difference

</I>&gt;<i> tinyxml...) in the source package.
</I>
I did the initial port to Autotools because more as one year ago
mapnik didn't build with Debian out of the box. I had to create many
boost symlinks by hand. Maybe that was because I was doing something
wrong. Another reason was the support for pkg-config that the rest of
my builds use. Also the pkg-config --uninstalled function that allows
to link again libraries in place without installing them. This saves a
lot of time. Now as I did the port to Autotools I don't like to throw
it away. Many distributions use the ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
way to easy create packages (e.g. gentoo).

But I don't like to vote against scons. If you don't like to switch
I'll be happy if you simply let the autotools files in SVN for me.

Andreas
