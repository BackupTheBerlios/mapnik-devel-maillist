</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello Dane,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do you think it would be possible to release an alternative package
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the autotools build environment beside the scons version?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'Beside'? you mean in addition?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't that the way it currently is? Sorry, I'm not very familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with autotools. Perhaps you mean to include also a pre-build
</I>&gt;<i> 'configure' as well?
</I>
Yes, the configure script needs to be included. Without the users have
to install all the autoconf, automake, libtool stuff.

In normal autotools environment you generate the package with &quot;make
dist&quot; or &quot;make distcheck&quot;. I could simply add a rule to include the
SConstruct files as extra data. Then packaging would be easier. Or two
different packages:

mapnik_scons-0.6.0.tar.gz
mapnik_autotools-0.6.0.tar.gz

each with its own build environment. Many ways are possible.

&gt;<i> I would love if you could document how to use the autotools stuff,  
</I>
I started a wiki page for it:

<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/BuildingwithAutotools">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/BuildingwithAutotools</A>

It's only a basic start and I hope more detailed information will be
added in the future.

&gt;<i> both in trunk and how you imagine it working for releases. See:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/124">http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/124</A>
</I>
I didn't know that ticket. The owner is 'andreas'. I'm a little
confused. My SVN name is 'andreas', but for some reasons I decided to
set my trac name to 'audifahrer'. So is this my ticket?

But anyway my account had no email address. I found out that I own
another ticket as 'audifahrer':

<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/291">http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/291</A>

I changed something with agg yesterday. Thanks. I've to check that.

&gt;<i> &gt; Then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people could choose the build environment they like. I've still some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open points,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there tickets for these?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> &gt; but I'll fix them in near future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How soon?  How about for the 0.6.1 release?
</I>
One was the python support that I added at latest. But it's not yet
complete tested. Another one was the missing utils compile support. I
fixed that one also.

I think that now all features are supported. What I really need are
testers and possible tickets. There are many build combinations and it
needs soooo long to build mapnik on my system. :-(

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/milestone/0.6.1">http://trac.mapnik.org/milestone/0.6.1</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note: I've assigned a date of two months from now purely as a rough  
</I>&gt;<i> idea of how long it should take to close the existing bug tickets.  
</I>&gt;<i> Other dev's please let me know your opinions and add thoughts to the  
</I>&gt;<i> milestone notes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And do you think it would be possible to include the kismet plugin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the next major release?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We tagged 0.6.0 from svn, so the Kismet plugin is there, just not
</I>&gt;<i> yet part of the SCons build scripts or 'wrapped' with a factory
</I>&gt;<i> method in the Python Bindings.
</I>
Would be great, because I've no knowledge of scons and only medium
knowledge of python. I use only the C++ API.

&gt;<i> These would be the two things in my mind to do next, in addition to  
</I>&gt;<i> documenting on its own wiki page.
</I>
Yes, a separate wiki page for kismet would be nice if more information
are added.

I recorded a video how it looks while driving around. I'll post it on
youtube shortly. Maybe I could add a link to the wiki.

regards
Andreas
