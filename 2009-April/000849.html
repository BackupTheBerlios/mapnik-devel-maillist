Yes, :)

Yes, boost library names are pretty complex and our SCons  
implementation for finding them (needed and) has improved quite a bit.

However, autodetection of boost library names when boost has been  
installed from source (and the install process did not create any  
symlinks) still could benefit from improvement and I plan to work on  
this in trunk before 0.7.0.

&gt;<i> Another reason was the support for pkg-config that the rest of

BTW, we are now commonly using built in pkg-config support with Scons  
to locate a number of dependencies.

&gt;<i> Also the pkg-config --uninstalled function that allows

Hm, I'm unfamiliar with this.

&gt;<i> Now as I did the port to Autotools I don't like to throw

I agree, and I'm glad you've started documenting it.

&gt;<i> But I don't like to vote against scons. If you don't like to switch

</I>
Cool.

So I guess we just need to remove the Autotools stuff when we package  
releases.
