Subject: [Mapnik-devel] Patch for Building Symbolizer
Message-ID: <CALXM1e13gE+9Ft2t54U4Go66kL6dntL84yc-y_OkV8TVNdDd1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I've prepared patch for building symbolizer that allows the height
parameter to be expression. Please provide any comments.

Where I could find any document how I could commit in easier manner to
trunk? Basically, a year ago we fork from mapnik trunk and implemented
couple of new features, you can check them on maps.tomtom.com, now we
would like to commit some of those back to trunk. We know that number
of our features are already there so it might take a while to identify
those valuable. Nevertheless we would like to commit and know your
process.

Thanks in advance for your response.

Best Regards
Cezary Tarnowski
