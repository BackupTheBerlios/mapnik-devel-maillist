Hello all,

Dominic Hargreaves just updated Mapnik Debian packages to the latest  
version 0.4.0.
Great news! Installing mapnik was never so easy:

sudo apt-get install python-mapnik

Have fun!

Message-ID: <4B8DFD4D-FE37-4270-B54A-98F710A6E60B@mapnik.org>

Hello,

I'm working on improving cross-platform support in Mapnik  
(concentrating on darwin at the moment) and I'd like to change data- 
source loader to expect _one_ file extension for input plug-ins on  
*nix,mac and win32.

So here some ideas:

1. *.plugin
2. *.input
3. *.plug

Any more?

Cheers,
Artem

Message-ID: <2545a92c0703151204t63f1ba1aw24ab1ff210456df1@mail.gmail.com>

If I'm reading the code [1] correctly,
mapnik.ogcserver.WMSBaseServiceHandler re-renders an image on each
request.

I'd like to add optional caching (modeled after django.core.cache) to
the WMSBaseServiceHandler.GetMap function.

Would such a patch be accepted?

Yep, sounds right.  Jean-Francois written WMS stuff but I'm pretty  
sure that is the case.

Cool!  But I wonder if caching pure WMS GetMap requests would be  
efficient.
They (requests) can be any bounding box so you might end up caching  
too much.
I think implementing caching of tiles at predefined scales make more  
sense.
Have you looked at metacarta's TileCache?  It uses filesystem which  
gets populated with tiles.

Yes, please! Sounds like you have something already. Django is using  
memcache or db for caching, right?
Anyway, 'caching'  would be great feature to have.

Cheers,
Artem

Ah, I suppose I should read a bit.  :)  I'm actually ignorant of WMS's
protocol, but I see WMS-C is a subset to help tiling caching.  My
eventual goal is to serve custom layers to GMaps via GTileLayer.

I'd already found this which deals with the GTileLayer -> WMS translation:
http://johndeck.blogspot.com/2006/02/layerwing-wms-services-with-googlemaps.html
http://chignik.berkeley.edu/google/wms236.js

I'll read up to see if that conforms to WMS-C.

I hadn't, but that seems to do exactly what I want, except it sits in
front of the eventual WMS.  I guess that's no hardship.  I think you
may have talked me out of doing it for Mapnik.  I should have realized
the common request protocol would allow for such coordination.

Django supports many cache backends: memcached, in-process, local (but
out-of-process), db, and filesystem.

They already did the hard work of making all those things act the same.  :)

Hmm, it seems TileCache may solve my immediate need.  Thanks for the
pointer.  I hope to give back to Mapnik the next time I have an itch.

No probs. TileCache has got support for Mapnik btw.
Here are tiles rendered by Mapnik, cached in MySQL and displayed as a  
custom layers in GMap:

Hello all,

Latest svn trunk  supports  building Mapnik on Mac (Intel).
I'm using gcc 4.0.1 from Xcode 2.4.1 and I'm building all  
dependencies from source ( not from Fink).
Thanks to Tom Carden for getting me interested in supporting Mac OS X  
and bambang for the initial patch.

Have fun,
Artem

Message-ID: <3A4A6D32-B87A-4F75-99FB-7E47B5F4CB63@mapnik.org>


Hello list,

Bart van den Eijnden from OSGIS kindly sponsored a copy of Vista for  
Mapnik. And as a result I'm planning to start distributing win32  
binaries for Mapnik.  This will include SDK (headers/libs) and also  
Python bindings. I'm building Mapnik and all its dependencies with MS  
native compiler (VC++ Express aka vc-8_0).

I understand that win32 binaries would benefit from having some kind  
of installer and after some googling I found: NSIS (http:// 
www.nullsoft.com). It's script based, Open Source installer for  
windows and it's used by many famous FOSS projects (including  
Debian). Unfortunately I'm lacking experience packaging win32  
software and I wonder if anyone on this list could help.

The binaries are ready to go and just waiting for a bit of installer  
magic.

Thanks in advance.

I have some experience using the Nullsoft installer, we use it to package 
our Windows installs. The documentation is pretty good but if you need to 
do things more complex than copying files and writing to the registry 
then they depend on you using various plugins.

Yes, since repository has moved mapnik-svn is no more. I'll need to  
check but I think you can subscribe to the feed on trac.mapnik.org to  
receive source updates.
