Hello all,

Just an update on Mapnik progress.

I'm working on text rendering and labels positioning at the moment. It
is still work in progress, but here are some first results:

hey folks,

 As a long time mapserver user I've gotten used to, shall we say,
barely acceptable map graphics so I was psyched to see the screenshots
of mapnik! Really great stuff.. now if only I could get it
installed....

I'm on Ubuntu 6.04 and got all the dependencies installed through
apt-get. One exception was the libboost_python libraries which, for
some reason ld was not picking up. I created a symbolic link from
/usr/lib/libboost_python-gcc-mt-1_33_1.so to
/usr/lib/libboost_python-gcc-mt.so and the build went smoothly, or so
I thought.

Importing the python module gives me the following errors:
>>> from mapnik import *
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/mapnik/__init__.py", line 28, in ?
    from _mapnik import *
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/libmapnik.so: undefined symbol:
_ZTIN5boost7archive6detail14basic_iarchiveE

I'm using the 0.2.5a release BTW. Any ideas??


Now to my questions:

1) Are there any plans to create a WMS server based on mapnik? I'd
imagine a twisted python implementation would be a good way to go. Any
one working on this?

2) Any plans to incorporate a GDAL and OGR plugin for raster and
vector data access? This would allow a huge number of supported
formats without reinventing the wheel.

Hi Matthew,

Thanks for trying Mapnik.

Looks very familiar.  I think Ubuntu for some reason using RC boost and 
not an official release or some libraries just missing??? It'll be 
easier to download boost _1_33_1 source and build fresh libs. Also 
0.2.5a is quite old by now. Why don't you try latest svn trunk I'll be 
happy to help?

I thought exactly about this approach.  Mapnik + Twisted = WMS (or even 
WFS one day). I think Jean Francois
is working on WMS implementation already,we should ask him. I don't 
really know Twisted that well, but it sounds  very good.  Another  
possible direction is to deploy Mapnik as a rendering engine for ka-map.

Yep, sure. Also, don't forget about FDO which might be a better solution 
for data access in a long run.

Cheers,
Artem

Yup, I'm working on a little demo script/data and an OGC server 
framework with a WMS server written in python.

The WMS framework for now is connection independent, though I'm starting 
simple with CGI and then FastCGI.  Once it's polished enough, it should 
be easy enough to integrate using other methods into a web server 
(mod_python for example) ...

Had to take a break from my computer screen for little while, and 
re-connect with the real world!  But I'll put some time in on that stuff 
this week-end :)
